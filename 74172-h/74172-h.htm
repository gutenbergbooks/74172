<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following texts and myths were obtained on the Queen Charlotte islands, British
Columbia, during the winter of 1900–01. They comprise all those procured at Skidegate,
the more southern of the two towns on these islands still regularly occupied, which
is made up of people from a number of towns that formerly existed along the eastern
and western coasts, whose speech differed in certain particulars from that of the
Haida on the northern coast. Since, however, all now live at Skidegate, their language
is conveniently called the Skidegate dialect. For a similar reason the language of
the northern Haida is called the Masset dialect, although it is spoken also in three
Alaskan towns—Howkan, Klinkwan, and Kasaan. For study and comparison one text in each
dialect has been given with interlinear translation, and twelve others with translations
on the page opposite. Although the remaining stories were also obtained in Haida,
English versions only are given, but they are kept as close to the original as possible.
</p>
<p>I have tried to handle the translations in such a way as to assist the philologist
without too far obscuring the meaning. Where obscure passages occur the notes will
usually clear them up.
</p>
<p>My interpreter was Henry Moody, who belongs to the principal family of Skedans, Those-born-at-Qā′gials,
and has since become its chief.
</p>
<p>For identifications of many of the plants and animals named in these stories I am
indebted to Dr<span class="corr" id="xd32e802" title="Not in source">.</span> C.&nbsp;F. Newcombe, of Victoria, British Columbia.

<p class="first">For convenience in study phonetic signs have been adopted similar to those employed

The vowels are ā, a, ä, ᴀ, ē, e, ê, ī, i, î, ō, o, ū, u, pronounced in the continental
manner. There is, however, no real distinction between corresponding e and i vowels
on the one hand and o and u vowels on the other. Apparently, two continental sounds
answer to one Haida sound that lies midway between them. Very slight u- or a- sounds
accompanying consonants occur in the Masset dialect and in Tlingit words, and are
indicated by <sup>u</sup> and <sup>a</sup>. Â (English aw) and ô (like o in stop) sometimes occur in songs. The consonants are

<p>A laryngeal catch (ʻ) takes the place of g̣ in the Masset dialect: x is also pronounced
softer, more like h. The fortes are accompanied by a slight pause or explosion in
utterance, and the laterals are related to l’s, coming nearest in intonation, however,
to the combinations dl and tl or kl; x is like German ch in <span lang="de">ach</span>; x̣ is formed farther forward; ñ is identical with ng in thing. The remaining sounds
are similar to the English sounds which their signs represent. Prolongation of a sound
is indicated by ⁺. Hyphens are used to separate some compound words, but more often
to mark that two successive vowel sounds do not form a diphthong. A pause or the omission
of a vowel is indicated by an apostrophe.

<p class="first center">[Told by Tom Stevens, chief of Those-born-at-House-point]
</p>
<p>During a famine a child asked his mother for something to eat. Then his mother cut
off the upper part of a dog salmon for him, and he thought it was not enough. He said
it was too small and began to cry.
</p>
<p>After he had cried for a while he went out with it. He chewed it up and put it into
a swampy place by the beach. Then the dog salmon swelled up there, and there was a
great quantity of it. He was sorry at having lost it. Then he began to cry.
</p>
<p>After he had cried for a while two persons came and stopped there in a narrow canoe
and invited him to get in. Then he got into it. After he had gone along with them
for a while the town came in sight, and they landed in its very middle, before the
chief’s house, <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>and he went up with them. Then they had him sit in the rear of the house and gave
him some food. A person sitting in the corner of the house, who was half rock,<a class="noteRef" id="n8.1src" href="#n8.1">1</a> said to him: “Do not eat that. I am half rock because I ate it.” So he did not eat.
</p>
<p>He went out to play with the children. One day there was such a great quantity of
salmon eggs about that he sat down and, inside of his blanket, put them into his mouth.
Then a child looked at him and shouted, “Moldy-forehead is eating our excrement.”
</p>
<p>Then the one who was half rock said to him: “When you are hungry go over to the stream
that flows by one end of the town. Then take out one of the salmon that come up into
it. Cut it open, and, when you have made a stick for it, roast it and eat up all the
parts. Put its bones into the fire.<a class="noteRef" id="n8.2src" href="#n8.2">2</a> Look about the place carefully [to see that none are left out].”
</p>
<p>Then he went thither and did as he was directed; and, after he came away, the eye
of the chief’s son became diseased. Then the one who was part rock told him to look
around in the place where he had eaten <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>salmon, and when he did so he found the hard part surrounding the salmon’s eye with
the stick stuck through it. He put it into the fire; and when he came back not the
least thing was ailing the one whose eye had been diseased. It had become well. The
souls of the Salmon people were what came into the creeks there.
</p>
<p>Then the person who was half rock said to him: “When you become hungry, go thither.
Take care of the bones. Put all into the fire.” And, when he became weak from hunger,
he went to it as directed, took salmon, made a fire for them, and ate them there.
One day the rib of some one became diseased. Then he again searched there. He found
a rib. That he also burned. When he returned the sick person had become well.
</p>
<p>One day, after he had been there for some time, people came dancing on their canoes.<a class="noteRef" id="n9.3src" href="#n9.3">3</a> Then they landed and began to dance in a house, and the one who was half rock said
to him: “Now go behind the town. <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>Then break off a young hemlock bough.<a class="noteRef" id="n10.4src" href="#n10.4">4</a> Shove it into the corner of the house over there where they are dancing. Do not look
in after it.”
</p>
<p>Then he did so, and when he felt strange (curious) about it, he looked in. His head
got stuck there. He barely could pull it away. His face was half covered with eggs.
He scraped them off with his fingers. And he pulled out the hemlock bough. The eggs
were thick on it. Then he went to the end of the town and ate them at the creek.
</p>
<p>Then the Herring people started off. Some time after that the Salmon people also began
to move. They started off in one canoe toward the surface of the earth.<a class="noteRef" id="n10.5src" href="#n10.5">5</a> They loaded the canoe. Some stood about with injured feet and eyes bound up, wanting
to go. The people refused to let them. After the provisions had been put on board
they hunted about among these, found some one, pulled him up, and threw him ashore.
They did not handle such carefully. One of these had hidden himself. In the fall many
of them have sore feet and their eyes are sore.<a class="noteRef" id="n10.6src" href="#n10.6">6</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Moldy-forehead also got in with them. After they had gone along for a while they
saw floating charcoal.<a class="noteRef" id="n11.7src" href="#n11.7">7</a> Part of them were lost there. After that they also came to where foam was floating.
There some of them were also lost.
</p>
<p>After they had gone along for a while from that place they came to the edge of the
sky and, standing near it, they counted the number of times it descended. After it
had closed five times they passed under it, and the canoe was broken in halves. It
was split in two.<a class="noteRef" id="n11.8src" href="#n11.8">8</a> Then few were left, they say.
</p>
<p>After they had gone on for a while longer they saw what looked like many stars. Those
were the salmon inlets, they say. Then three, four, or five got off the canoe. Where
the inlets were large ten got off. Then they came to where people stood at the mouth
of the creek. After they had been there for a while they stood up and the people said
“Ē′yo.”<a class="noteRef" id="n11.9src" href="#n11.9">9</a> Then they made them ashamed, and they sat down. People kept saying “Ē′yo” to them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>When it was evening he saw his mother with pitch on her face<a class="noteRef" id="n12.10src" href="#n12.10">10</a> weeping. He also saw his father walking about. After they had gone along for a while
they said they had built a fort for them. Two went up to see it and said it was not
quite finished. After that they went up again to see it. They said it was not quite
finished; but the next time they went up to see it they said it was finished.
</p>
<p>Then it was fine weather, and they pulled off a pole from inside the edges of the
canoe and shook the sky with it. At once rain began to fall. Those in the canoe were
happy. They prepared themselves. They shook their insides with anger, because they
were going to fight the fort. That [the fort] was a fish trap, they say. At once they
started up in a crowd.
</p>
<p>He recognized his mother and swam ashore in front of her. Then his mother tried to
club him, and he escaped into the creek. And when he did the same thing again he let
his mother club him to death.
</p>
<p>And when his mother started to cut off his head for immediate cooking the knife clicked
upon something on his neck, and she looked. She recognized the copper necklace her
son used to have around his neck.<a class="noteRef" id="n12.11src" href="#n12.11">11</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>Then she put him upon a clean board. And his father stayed in the house [instead of
going fishing]. She put him on the top of the house.
</p>
<p>After four nights had passed over him a slight noise began in his throat. The top
of his head came out. As the nights passed, he continued to come out. By and by the
salmon skin was washed off him by the rain,<a class="noteRef" id="n13.12src" href="#n13.12">12</a> and he entered the house. Then he became a shaman. They sang for him.
</p>
<p>They moved away, and the next year they came to the same place to get salmon. When
the salmon came again and ran up a shining one was on top. Then he told them not to
spear it, but it was the very one they tried to spear. By and by he made a spear for
himself and speared it. When he had pulled it ashore, and the salmon died, he, too,
died. He did not know that it was his own soul.
</p>
<p>Then they made him sit up and sat above his head. They dressed some one to look like
him, who went round the fire while they sang.<a class="noteRef" id="n13.13src" href="#n13.13">13</a> They also beat his drum. At the same time they sang for him. After four nights were
passed they put him into a pool where salt and fresh <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>water mingled, where he had directed that he should be placed. They laid him upon
the plank on which he used to lie. Then they put him there (in the pool). They also
put his drum there. After this had turned around to the right for a while it vanished
into a deep hole in the bottom. And now, when there is going to be plenty of salmon,
they hear his drum sound in the deep place.
</p>
<p>Here the story ends.
</p>
<p class="small">As might have been expected, this story was a very popular one along the salmon-frequented
North Pacific coast, and several different versions of it have been already recorded.
An excellent one was obtained by myself in English from an old Kaigani, derived from
the Tlingit, among whom it appears to have originated. This will be found in volume
<span class="asc">V</span> of the Memoirs of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition, part <span class="asc">I</span>, pages 243 to 245. Apart from linguistics, the story is interesting from the point
of view of Indian psychology. It was related by the present chief of Those-born-at-House-point
(<span lang="hax">Na-iku′n qe′ig̣awa-i</span>), once the leading family of Rose Spit and Cape Ball, on the eastern coast of Graham
island.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Isaac, of the <span lang="hdn">Łi′elᴀñ qē′awai</span> family.]
</p>
<p><span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span> lived at End-of-trail town.<a class="noteRef" id="n15.1src" href="#n15.1">1</a> All of his friends also lived there. And he went out to fish. And, the wind blowing
from the shore, he was blown away. He was unable to get to land. He was blown about
in the sea all day. And while he was being blown about evening came upon him. He was
also blown about during the night. And morning again dawned upon him. He did not see
land. And he was again blown about all day. But the wind did not blow hard. Therefore
he did not capsize. While he was being blown about evening again came upon him. He
was again blown about all night. He was blown about for a long time. And morning again
dawned upon him. During all that time he saw no land.
</p>
<p>Then <span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span> sang because he wanted the wind to become fair. And <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>he stood in the canoe. He began to sing: “Lake (i.e., Ocean) spirit, calm the waves
for me. Get close to me, my Power. My heart is tired. Make the sea very calm for me,
<span lang="hdn">ye hō yē hō′ lō!</span>” etc.<a class="noteRef" id="n16.2src" href="#n16.2">2</a> While he was still being blown about evening came upon him. And again morning dawned
upon him. Although it was foggy in the morning the wind was not strong. He floated
about at random. Every evening shut down foggy. And he was unable to stand up. His
legs were weak, because he had been long in the canoe. Then he again sang the same
song. And morning came again. He could see no land. And, while it was still foggy
evening came upon him. All that time the wind was not strong. Again morning dawned
upon him.
</p>
<p>Then he floated near to land. He remained floating there. He did not get off for his
legs were bent together. During all that time they did not see him. Although he was
very near where people lived they did not see him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he saw a child playing about, one not grown but big enough to talk. And the child
did not see him for his canoe was floating close to a rock. Then <span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span> called to the child because he wished them to know about him. And, when he called,
the child was afraid to go to him. After it had been afraid for some time [<span class="corr" id="xd32e8438" lang="hdn" title="Source: Īłdī′nī">Îłdī′nī</span>] said: “I am Îłdī′nī.” It was a male child. And it went out to him. And it came and
stood near him. And he said to it: “My name is <span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span>.” “Now you, too, say ‘<span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span>,’ ” said he to it. And the child said “<span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span>,” but said it wrong because it did not yet know how to talk very well. He pronounced
his name again. And the child also pronounced his name. It said it right. And the
child started away from him.
</p>
<p>Then it turned away from him. It began saying, “<span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī, Îłdī′nī, Îłdī′nī, Îłdī′nī, Îłdī′nī, Îłdī′nī.</span>” It was afraid of forgetting his [name]. And when it got some distance away it forgot
his <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>name again. Then it returned to him. And, when it came to him he again told it his
name. “Say ‘<span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span>’,” said <span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span> to this child. And the child in turn said so. And again it said it right. Then, as
it went away from him, it began repeating his name. “<span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī, Îłdī′nī, Îłdī′nī</span>,” it began saying. While it was saying “<span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span>” it entered the house. That time it did not forget the name.
</p>
<p>And, even while opening the door, it kept repeating “<span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span>.” The child said to its grandfather: “Grandfather, find <span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span>; grandfather, find <span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span>.” And it led its grandfather to the place from whence it had come. They came to where
he floated. The wife was also with them. And, being at once much troubled at the sight
of him, they quickly got into his canoe. They came in front of their house with him.
</p>
<p>When they got out they wanted to take him up to the house quickly. Then he showed
them his legs. He also showed them that he was unable to stand. He merely made signs
with his fingers. He <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>did not know their language. And the man ran up for his mat. And, when he brought
it down, they placed him upon the mat. Then they carried him into the house. They
placed him near the fire.
</p>
<p>Then they put warm things upon him. And they also warmed him at the fire. They also
put warm things on his head. They also warmed water for his legs. And, when the water
became warmed a little, the woman began putting it upon his legs. At the same time
the man also kept warm things on his head. And, as he sat there, he tried to straighten
his legs a little. They became well. They stopped putting hot water on them.
</p>
<p>And, when he asked for a stick, they gave it to him. And, after they gave it to him,
he raised himself up. He tried to go outside. And, after he had sat outside for a
while, he came back again with the help of his stick. They did not give him food because
they saw that something was the matter with him. Although they had not seen him before
they saw that he was a chief.
</p>
<p>Then they warmed water for him. They also cooked food for him. <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>And, when the water was warm, she put a great deal of grease into it, and they set
it before him. She also gave him a spoon. This is how the ancient people did. And
after he had drunk the broth she also set food before him. She let him eat grease
with it. And after he was through eating she put another kind of food before him.
When she saw that he ate his food as if he were well she gave him another kind of
food.
</p>
<p>And he (the husband) saw that he had become well, and he said to his wife: “When the
wind is fair we will go with him to the town.” It was evening. And they did not sleep
during the night because they wanted to go to the town with him. But the chief slept
soundly. And while he slept they put their things on the beach. They also launched
their canoe. And they put their things into the canoe. They did not live far from
the town. And when he awoke they told him they were going away with him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the woman went in their canoe. The man went with him in his canoe. They came
to the town with him. And the people were astonished at them. Before that they had
one canoe. And when [they saw] that they had two they were surprised at them. They
were a great crowd waiting outside for them. Then they saw another person sitting
in their [canoe].
</p>
<p>And when they came ashore the whole town went to them, for they had never seen him
before. They came with him to the Stikine town. They quickly took him into the house.
And the house was full of Stikine people, men, women, and children. They were surprised
to see him. Although they had never seen him before, they saw that he was a chief.
</p>
<p>And now the one who came to the town with him said to the crowd: “When my grandchild
went out to play it found this person. It went to play. After it had been gone for
a while it came in. Then, <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>as it opened the door, it came in saying ‘<span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī, Îłdī′nī</span>. Grandfather, <span lang="hdn">Îłdī′nī</span> found,’ it said. So we went to see him. And we took him into the house. He was unable
to stand. His legs were bent together. And we carried him up in a mat to the house.
We worked over him all day [to make him well]. And after he did stand up he went outside
with the help of a cane. Then we gave him food. When he got well we came this way
with him. I came hither with him because I did not want to remain alone with him in
an uninhabited place,”<a class="noteRef" id="n22.3src" href="#n22.3">3</a> he said.
</p>
<p>While they were telling about him the people observed that he was feeling of his skin
with his teeth. And they told one another about what he did. Then the chiefs of the
Stikine people said: “Taste the chief’s blood.” Then one felt of his skin with his
teeth. And when he lifted his head he said: “The chief’s blood is salt.” Then the
chiefs of the Stikine people were very much astonished. Then they knew that he had
been blown about for a very long time. And the town <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>people went outside. Then they knew what had happened to him, but they did not know
whence he had come.
</p>
<p>And they began to care for him. He was there for many years. And he remained there
always. He did not go back, because he did not know where his town was. He had four
children. Two were boys and two were girls. And all the time he was at the Stikine
he wept for his children. But he did not weep for his wife.<a class="noteRef" id="n23.4src" href="#n23.4">4</a> And the one who had found him made him his friend (i.e., took him into his family
and clan).
</p>
<p>And after he had lived there for a long time he came to understand their language.
After he had wept for a while he sang a crying song. He began the following crying
song: <span lang="hdn">𝄆&nbsp;“Hēg̣ōnōnē′ ʟa′gwaiyē djū′qoqołtēdj.&nbsp;𝄇 Ha gūsē′, ha gūsē′ łē′nī gîta′nī hagūsē′.</span>”<a class="noteRef" id="n23.5src" href="#n23.5">5</a> And he joined that tribe. Then he told them that he had belonged to the Fish-eggs
and they all gave themselves to him because they saw that he was a chief. And his
friends, the Fish-eggs, lost him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>And by and by his friends heard that he was a chief of the Stikine. In old times people
did not go to other places. They fastened a feather to the end of a stick, and they
raised it. If the feather was not moved by the wind they went out.<a class="noteRef" id="n24.6src" href="#n24.6">6</a> Therefore his people did not learn about him quickly. But afterward they heard about
him. And when he knew that his friends had heard about him he sent down the songs
for his friends. By and by, when they heard his [songs], his friends were very glad.
“Although I want to go to you, there is no way to do so. I am very well off. But there
I was not happy. My friends, the women and men of the Fish-eggs, are very numerous.”<a class="noteRef" id="n24.7src" href="#n24.7">7</a> Then his friends ceased to be sad for him, because they knew he was happy. But his
wife was married to another man, for they had thought that he was dead.
</p>
<p>This is the end.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p class="small">The almost complete absence of a mythic element in this story suggests that it may
be founded on fact. At least it must have been used to explain a relationship supposed
to exist between the Fish-eggs, a branch of the great Stᴀ′stas family of Masset, which
belonged to the Eagle clan, and some family among the Stikine Indians.

<p class="small">This is one of the most important of all Haida stories, telling as it does of the
incarnation of the sky god, the highest deity anciently recognized by them. Sîñ, the
name by which he is known, is the ordinary word for day as distinguished from night
and from an entire period of twenty-four hours, which also is called “night;” but
it seems to be more strictly applied to the sky above as it is illuminated by sunshine.
Hence I have chosen to translate the word “Shining-heavens.” A similar conception
is found among the Tsimshian of the neighboring mainland, where the sky god is known
as Laxha′. It would be interesting to learn whether it also obtains among the related
Tlingit of Alaska.

The next will be called ‘Supernatural-being-who-keeps-the-bow-off.’ He will give orders.
Wherever you give people supernatural power he will push the canoe. And the next younger

Now, brothers, set yourselves in the canoe. Paddle to Stā′ngwai.<a class="noteRef" id="n40.11src" href="#n40.11">11</a> It is he who paints up those who are going to be supernatural beings. He will paint

who were supposed to speak through shamans, how they received their names, etc. The
headdresses here referred to are the elaborate structures with carved wooden fronts,
sea-lion bristles around the tops, and rows of weasel skins down the backs. Things
thrown into the fire were supposed to go to the land of souls, hence the idea of sending

<p>One time the raven sat in front of her and made motions as if it were eating something.
Then she went to it. Chitons were piled up there. She picked them up and gave them
to her uncles’ wives. And next day she again went after things that were exposed at
low tide and gave the things to one to whom she had not given them before. The raven

he brought out a hawk feather, put it into the corner of [the chief’s son’s] eye,

a while longer something touched their heads. This, they felt, was the kelp under
which [the otters] were diving with them. After they had gone along for a while longer
they said that they were near the town.

people made nets. And, after they had fished with them for a while, one night they

Over it she wore a flicker blanket. They saw it. While they fished they put words

early doings of a Haida family which used to occupy the east shore of Moresby island,
between Skidegate inlet and Cumshewa point. Skidegate creek runs through the middle
of their territory and was their most important stream. This fact accounts for the
prominence of the Creek-woman of Skidegate creek in the legends. <span class="corr" id="xd32e20230" title="Source: Food-giving town">Food-giving-town</span> (Daiyū′) was on Shingle bay, on the south side of Skidegate inlet. In 1901 there

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#n70.4src">4</a></span> There were two families of this name reputed to have come from the same stem. One
occupied many towns on the southeastern coast of Moresby island, but is now almost
extinct. The other settled first at Tꜝē, on the northwest coast of Graham island,
and subsequently emigrated to Kasaan, Alaska, where their descendants still live.

if he were choked. They then said: “Go and get the chief.” And they held him up. Marten
was Black-bear’s elder brother.

<p>One fall both had been gathering salmon, and he said to Black-bear: “Younger brother,
stand in the creek downstream. I will stand above in the creek. I will float down
to you the bodies of those I kill.”
</p>
<p>They did it at once, and his younger brother, Black-bear, went into the creek below
and stood there. Now, as soon as Marten got into the creek above he floated one down,
and his younger brother below threw it out.
</p>
<p>He was at some distance from where they lived. After he had been gone for some time
he came in to his wife and children, and as he caressed his children he said: “Fresh
salmon, my daughter, fresh salmon.” Now, she went out to get them and saw nothing.
Then she came in and said to her father: “Father, I saw nothing there.” And he said
to his daughter: “They lie just outside, my daughter.” Now, she again went out. Again
she could not find them. “Father, only gills [with entrails attached] lie outside.”
“Those are the things, my daughter.” She then brought them in and roasted them. And
he went opposite to where they were being cooked and said: “[Give me] the milt of
a salmon.”<a class="noteRef" id="n96.5src" href="#n96.5">5</a>.</p>

<p>Over this island<a class="noteRef" id="n110.1src" href="#n110.1">2</a> salt water extended, they say. Raven flew about. He looked for a place upon which
to sit. After a while he flew away to sit upon a flat rock which lay toward the south
end of the island. All the supernatural creatures lay on it like Genō′,<a class="noteRef" id="n110.2src" href="#n110.2">3</a> with their necks laid across one another. The feebler supernatural beings were stretched
out from it in this, that, and every direction, asleep. It was light then, and yet
dark, they say.
</p>
<p class="center">[Told by Job Moody of the Witch People<a class="noteRef" id="n110.3src" href="#n110.3">4</a>]
</p>
<p>The Loon’s place<a class="noteRef" id="n110.4src" href="#n110.4">5</a> was in the house of Nᴀñkî′lsʟas. One day he went out and called. Then he came running
in and sat down in the place he always occupied. And an old man was lying down there,
but never looking toward him. By and by he went out a second time, cried, came in,
and sat down. He continued to act in this manner.
</p>
<p>One day the person whose back was turned to the fire asked: “Why do you call so often?”
“Ah, chief, I am not calling on my own account. The supernatural ones tell me that
they have no place in which to settle. That is why I am calling.” And he said: “I
will attend to it (literally, ‘make’).”
</p>
<p class="center">[Continued by John Sky]
</p>
<p>After having flown about for a while Raven was attracted by the neighboring clear
sky. Then he flew up thither. And running his beak into it from beneath he drew himself
up. A five-row town lay there, and in the front row the chief’s daughter had just
given birth to a child. In the evening they all slept. He then skinned the child from
the foot and entered [the skin]. He lay down in its place.
</p>
<p>On the morrow its grandfather asked for it, and it was given to him. He washed it,
and he put his feet against the baby’s feet and pulled up. He then put it back. On
the next day he did the same thing and handed it back to its mother. He was now hungry.
They had not begun to chew up food to put into his mouth.
</p>
<p>One evening, after they had all gone to bed and were asleep, Raven raised his head
and looked about upon everything inside the house. All slept in the same position.
Then by wriggling continually he <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>loosened himself from the cradle in which he was fastened and went out. In the corner
of the house lived a Half-rock being,<a class="noteRef" id="n111.5src" href="#n111.5">6</a> who watched him. After she had watched for a while he came in, holding something
under his blanket, and, pushing aside the fire which was always kept burning before
his mother, he dug a hole in the cleared place and emptied what he held into it. As
soon as he had kneaded it with the ashes he ate it. It gave forth a popping sound.
He laughed while he ate. She saw all that from the corner.
</p>
<p>Again, when it was evening and they were asleep, he went out. After he had been gone
for a while he again brought in something under his blanket, put it into the ashes
and stirred it up with them. He poked it out and laughed as he ate it. From the corner
of the house the Half-rock one looked on. He got through, went back, and lay down
in the cradle. On the next morning all the five villages talked about it. He heard
them.
</p>
<p>The inhabitants of four of the five towns had each lost one eye. Then the old woman
reported what she had seen. “Behold what that chief’s daughter’s child does. Watch
him. As soon as they sleep he stands up out of himself.” His grandfather then gave
him a marten-skin blanket, and they put him into the cradle. At his grandfather’s
word some one went out. “Come to sing a song for the chief’s daughter’s baby outsi-i-ide,
outsi-i-ide.” As they sang for him one in the line, which extended along the entire
village front, held him. By and by he let him fall, and they watched him as he went.
Turning around to the right as he went, he struck the water.
</p>
<p>And as he drifted about he cried without ceasing. By and by, wearied out with crying,
he fell asleep. After he had slept a while something said: “Your mighty grandfather
says he wants you to come into his house.” He turned around quickly and looked out
from under his blanket, but saw nothing. Again, as he floated about, something repeated
the same words. He looked quickly around toward it. He saw nothing. The next time
he looked through the eyehole in his <span class="corr" id="xd32e21940" title="Source: marten skin">marten-skin</span>. A pied-billed grebe came out from under the water, saying “Your mighty grandfather
invites you in,” and dived immediately.
</p>
<p>He then got up. He was floating against a kelp with two heads. He stepped upon it.
Lo! he stepped upon a house pole of rock having two heads. He climbed down it. The
sea was just as good as the world above.<a class="noteRef" id="n111.6src" href="#n111.6">7</a>
</p>
<p>He then stood in front of a house. And some one called him in: “Enter, my son. Word
has arrived that you come to borrow something from me.” He then went in. An old man,
white as a sea gull, sat in the rear part of the house. He sent him for a box that
hung in the corner, and, as soon as he had handed it to him, he successively pulled
out five boxes. And out of the innermost box he handed him <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>two cylindrical objects, one covered with shining spots, the other black, saying “I
am you. That [also] is you.” He referred to something blue and slim that was walking
around on the screens whose ends point toward each other in the rear of the house.
And he said to him: “Lay this round [speckled] thing in the water, and after you have
laid this black one in the water, bite off a part of each and spit it upon the rest.”
</p>
<p>But when he took them out he placed the black one in the water first and, biting off
part of the speckled stone, spit it upon the rest, whereupon it bounded off. Because
he did differently from the way he was told it came off. He now went back to the black
one, bit a part of it off and spit it upon the rest, where it stuck. Then he bit off
a part of the pebble with shiny points and spit it upon the rest. It stuck to it.
These were to be trees, they say.<a class="noteRef" id="n112.7src" href="#n112.7">8</a>
</p>
<p>When he put the second one into the water it stretched itself out. And the supernatural
beings at once swam over to it from their places on the sea. In the same way Mainland<a class="noteRef" id="n112.8src" href="#n112.8">9</a> was finished and lay quite round on the water.
</p>
<p>He floated first in front of this island (i.e., the Queen Charlotte islands), they
say. And he shouted landward: “Gū′sga wag̣elai′dx̣ᴀn hā-ō-ō” (Tsimshian words meaning
“Come along quickly”) [but he saw nothing]. Then [he shouted]: “Ha′lᴀ gudᴀñā′ñ łg̣ā′gîñ
gwā′-ā-ā” (Haida equivalent of the preceding). Some one came toward the water. Then
he went toward Mainland. He called to them to hurry, [saying] “Hurry up in your minds,”
but he saw nothing. He spoke in the Tsimshian tongue. Then one with an old-fashioned
cape and a paddle over his shoulder came seaward. This is how he started it that the
Mainland people would be industrious.
</p>
<p>Pushing off again toward this country, he disembarked near the south end of the island.
On a ledge a certain person was walking. Toward the woods, too, among fallen trees,
walked another. Then he knocked him who was walking along the shore into the water.
Yet he floated, face up. When he again knocked him in the same thing was repeated.
He was unable to drown him. This was because the Ninstints people were going to practise
witchcraft. And he who was walking among the trees had his face cut by the limbs.
He did not wipe it. This was Greatest-crazy-one (Qōnā′ñ-sg̣ā′na), they say.
</p>
<p>He then turned seaward and started for the Heiltsuk coast (ʟdjîñ).<a class="noteRef" id="n112.9src" href="#n112.9">10</a> As he walked along he came to a spring salmon that was jumping about and said to
it: “Spring-salmon, strike me over the heart.” Then it turned toward him. It struck
him. Just as he recovered from his insensibility it went into the sea. Then he built
a stone wall close to the sea and behind it made another. When he told it to do the
same thing again the spring salmon hit him, and, while he was on the ground, after
jumping along for a while, it knocked over the <span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>nearer wall. But while it was yet moving along inside the farther wall he got up,
hit it with a club, killed it, and took it up.<a class="noteRef" id="n113.10src" href="#n113.10">11</a>
</p>
<p>He then called in the crows to help him eat it. They made a fire and roasted it [on
hot stones]. He afterward lay down with his back to the fire. He told them to wake
him when it was cooked. He then overslept. And they took everything off from the fire
and ate. They ate everything. They then poked some of the salmon between his teeth.
And he awoke after he had slept a while and told them to take the covering off the
roast. And they said to him: “You ate it. After that you went to sleep.” “No, indeed,
you have not taken the coverings off yet.” “Well, poke a stick between your teeth.”
He then poked a stick between his teeth. He poked out some from his teeth. He thereupon
spit into the crows’ faces and said: “Future people shall not see you flying about
looking as you do now.” They were white, they say, but since that time they have been
black.
</p>
<p>And walking away from that place he sat down near the end of a trail. After he had
wept there for a while some people with feathers on their heads and gambling-stick
bags on their backs came to him and asked him what the matter was. “Oh, my mother
and my father are dead. Because they told me I was born [in the same place] as you
I wander about seeking you.” They then started home with him. Lo, they came to a house.
Then they made him sit down. One of the men went around behind the screens by the
wall passage. After staying away for a while [he came in and] his legs were wet. He
brought a salmon with its back just broken. They rubbed white stones against each
other to make a fire. Near it they cut the salmon open. They put stones into the fire,
roasted the salmon, and, when it was cooked, made him sit down in the middle. There
they ate it. These were the Beavers, they say. They were going out to gamble, but
turned back on account of him.
</p>
<p>One of them again went behind the screens. He brought out a dish of cranberries, and
that, too, they finished. Again he went in. He brought out the inside parts of a mountain
goat, and they divided them into three portions, and made Raven’s portion big. Then
they said to him: “You had better not go away. Live with us always.” They then put
their gambling-stick bags upon their backs and started off.
</p>
<p>When it was near evening they came home. He was sitting in the place [where they had
left him]. Again one went in. He again brought out a salmon. They steamed it. And
they also brought out cranberries. They also brought out the inside parts of a mountain
goat. After they had eaten they went to bed. On the next day, early in the morning,
after they had eaten three sorts of food, they put the gambling-stick bags upon their
backs and started off again.
</p>
<p>He then went behind the screen. Lo, a lake lay there. From it a creek flowed away
in which was a fish trap. The fish trap was so <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>full that it looked as if some one were shaking it. There were plenty of salmon in
it, and in the lake very many small canoes were passing one another. Several points
were red with cranberries. Lēn<a class="noteRef" id="n114.11src" href="#n114.11">12</a> and women’s songs<a class="noteRef" id="n114.12src" href="#n114.12">13</a> resounded.
</p>
<p>Then he pulled out the fish trap, folded it together, and laid it down at the edge
of the lake. He rolled it up with the lake and house, put them under his arm, and
pulled himself up into a tree that stood close by. They were not heavy for his arm.
</p>
<p>He then came down and straightened them out. And he lighted a fire, ran back quickly,
brought out a salmon, and cooked it hurriedly. He ate it quickly and put the fire
out again. Then, sitting beside it, he cried.
</p>
<p>As he sat there, without having wiped away his tears, they came in. “Well, why are
you crying?” “I am crying because the fire went out some time ago.” They then talked
to each other, and one of them said to him: “That is always the way with it.”
</p>
<p>They then lighted the fire. One of them brought out a salmon from behind [the screens]
and they cut it across, steamed, and ate it. After they had finished eating cranberries
and the inside parts of a mountain goat they went to bed. The next morning, very early,
after they had again eaten the three kinds of food, they took their gambling-stick
bags upon their backs and went off.
</p>
<p>He at once ran inside. He brought out a salmon, cooked it, and ate it with cranberries
and the inside parts of a mountain goat. He then went in and pulled up the fish trap.
He flattened it together with the house.
</p>
<p>After he had laid them down he rolled the lake up with them and put all into his armpit.
He pulled himself up into a tree standing beside the lake. Halfway up he sat down.
</p>
<p>And after he had sat there for a while some one came. His house and lake were gone
from their accustomed place. After he had looked about the place for some time he
glanced up. Lo, he (Raven) sat there with their property. Then he went back, and both
came toward him. They went quickly to the tree. They began working upon it with their
teeth. When it began to fall, he (Raven) went to another one. When that, too, began
to fall he sat down with his [burden] on one that stood near it. After he had gone
ahead of them upon many trees in the same way they gave it up. They then traveled
about for a long time, they say. After having had no place for a long time they found
a lake and settled down in it.
</p>
<p>Then, after he (Raven) had traveled around inland for a while, he came to a large
open place. He unrolled the lake there. There it lay. He did not let the fish trap
or the house go. He kept them to teach the Seaward (Mainland) people and the Shoreward
(Queen Charlotte islands) people, they say.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>While he was walking along near the edge of the water [he saw] a part of some creature
looking like a woman sticking out of the water at the mouth of Lalgī′mi.<a class="noteRef" id="n115.13src" href="#n115.13">14</a> He was fascinated by her, made a canoe, and went to her. When he got near she went
under the water in front of him. After he had made a canoe of something different
he went to her again. When he got near to her she sank into the water. He made one
of something still different. Again she sank into the water before him.
</p>
<p>Now, after he had searched about for a while, he opened a wild pea (xō′ya ʟū′g̣a,
“Raven’s canoe”) with a stick and went out to her in it. When he came near to get
her that time she did not go under the water. He came alongside of her and took her
in. She wore a dancing skirt and dancing leggings. He then got the canoe ashore, untied
her dancing leggings and dancing skirt, and wiped her all over. He ran to the woods,
got a tcā′łg̣a,<a class="noteRef" id="n115.14src" href="#n115.14">15</a> and drew it over her for a blanket.
</p>
<p>He then launched the canoe and put her in it, and they started landward.<a class="noteRef" id="n115.15src" href="#n115.15">16</a> He set her ashore on the west arm of Cumshewa inlet (G̣a′oqons) and also took out
the house for her, but kept the fish trap in his armpit. He did so because he was
going to teach [some one] about it.
</p>
<p>He then went back again. After he had passed along Seaward land (the mainland) in
his canoe for some time, behold, a person came along by canoe. The hair on the top
of his head was gathered in a pointed tuft. And he (Raven) held his canoe off at arm’s
length for a while. The canoe was full of hair seal. Then he questioned him: “Tell
me, where did you gather the things you have?” “Why, there are plenty of them” [he
replied], and he picked up his hunting spear. After he had looked between the canoes
he speared something. He pulled out a hair seal. “Look in” [he said], and he (Raven)
looked in. He could see nothing. “I say, I am this way (i.e., have bad eyesight) because
a clam spit upon me. Since then I have been unable to see anything.” He then stretched
his head over. He stretched it to him. And, having pulled a blood clot out of his
eye with his finger nails, he put it back again. He used bad words to him, therefore
he did not take it out for good. Now, he (Raven) treated him well. He made many advances
to him, but he could not get [what he wanted] and started off.
</p>
<p>After he had gone along for some time, lo, Eagle<a class="noteRef" id="n115.16src" href="#n115.16">17</a> was coming; and he said to him: “Comrade, I have been drinking sea water. You, too,
had better drink sea water.” And he drank some in his sight. At once he defecated
as he went along. Then Eagle, too, drank some. He also defecated as he went, and he
said: “Cousin, come, let us build a fire.” “Wait, I am looking for the place.” Then
Eagle pulled a water-tight basket out from under his armpit and drank from <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>it. At once what he had drunk spurted from his mouth as he went along. After they
had gone along for a while they landed upon certain flat rocks extending into the
sea.
</p>
<p>Then Raven went up first and lighted a fire. He again watched Eagle as he kept taking
out his basket and drinking water. He intended to take it, but he did not have an
opportunity. Eagle also let the contents of his stomach run into the ground, and they
went out of sight. Then he (Raven) took a walk. “I am going to drink,” he said, and
passed into the woods. Having taken roots and put root sap into the hat he wore, he
went to him. While coming back he drank of it on the way. And he asked Eagle to taste
it. He handed it to him. He looked into it. He sniffed at it. “Tell me, cousin, why
does your water smell like pitch?” “Well, cousin, the water hole was in clay.”
</p>
<p>He then broke off tips of branches from a hemlock that had clusters of twigs sticking
out all round them and gave them to him. “Cousin, put these upon the fire.” And he
put them upon the fire. Wā-ā-ā, it burned brightly. And after he had done this a while,
lo, Eagle pulled out his basket. As soon as he saw that, he (Raven) ran to the end
of a clump of limbs and stepped heavily upon it to break it. “Clump of branches, fall
down, fall down” [he said], and it broke and was coming down. Then he said to Eagle,
“Hukukukuk.”<a class="noteRef" id="n116.17src" href="#n116.17">18</a> Eagle ran from his water in terror.
</p>
<p>Then Raven put on his feather clothing and flew away with it. Eagle, too, put on his
feather clothing and flew after him. He tried to hook his claws into him, and water
was jerked out of [the basket]. As this happened the salmon streams were formed. Eagle
gave up the pursuit, and he (Raven) continued scattering water out of his mouth. After
a while he emptied the last where he had stretched out the first [lake]. He treated
this island in the same manner. After that he emptied [the last] at the head of Skeena.<a class="noteRef" id="n116.18src" href="#n116.18">19</a>
</p>
<p>Eagle was also called Lā′g̣ałᴀm.<a class="noteRef" id="n116.19src" href="#n116.19">20</a>
</p>
<p>Raven finished this. He then traveled northward. After he had traveled for a while
he came to where a village lay. He then put himself in the form of a conifer needle
into a water hole behind the chief’s house and floated about there awaiting the chief’s
daughter.
</p>
<p>The chief’s child then went thither for water, and he floated in the water that she
dipped up. She threw this out and dipped a second time, but he was still there. And
when close to her he said: “Drink it.”
</p>
<p>Not a long time after that she became pregnant. Then she gave birth [to a child],
and its grandfather washed the child all over and put his feet to its feet. It began
to creep about. After it had crept about for a while it cried so violently that no
one could stop it. “Boo hoo, moon,” it kept saying. After it had tired them out with
<span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>its crying they stopped up the smoke hole, and, having pulled one box out of another
four times, they gave it a round thing. There came light throughout the house. After
it had played with this for a while it let it go and again started to cry. “Boo hoo,
smoke hole,” it cried. They then opened the smoke hole, and it cried again and said:
“Boo hoo, more.” And they made the space larger. Then he flew away with it. Marten<a class="noteRef" id="n117.20src" href="#n117.20">21</a> pursued him below. Tā′ʟᴀtg̣ā′dᴀla,<a class="noteRef" id="n117.21src" href="#n117.21">22</a> too, chased him above. They gave it up and returned.
</p>
<p>He then put the moon into his armpit. And, after he had traveled about for a while,
he came to where Sea-gull and Cormorant sat. He made them quarrel with each other.
And he said to Cormorant: “People tell me to brace myself on the ground with my tongue
this way [when fighting].” He then did it, and [Raven] went quickly to him. He bit
off his tongue.
</p>
<p>Then he made it into an eulachon. And he put on his cape and rubbed this all over
it, and he rubbed it on the inside of the canoe as well. Then he also put rocks in
and went in front of Qadadjâ′n.<a class="noteRef" id="n117.22src" href="#n117.22">23</a> And he entered his house. “Hī, I, too, have become cold.” Qadadjâ′n was lying with
his back to the fire and, looking toward him, saw his canoe, covered with slime, lying
on the water as if full. He then became angry and pulled the screen down toward the
fire. Eulachon immediately poured forth. He then threw the stones <span class="corr" id="xd32e22058" title="Source: out out">out</span> of the canoe and put them into it. When it was full, he went off with them.
</p>
<p>After he had distributed the eulachon along the mainland in the places where they
now are and had put some in Nass inlet, he left a few in the canoe.
</p>
<p>He then placed ten paddles under these, of which the bottom one had a knot hole running
through it. And he shouted landward to where a certain person lived. She then brought
out a basket<a class="noteRef" id="n117.23src" href="#n117.23">24</a> on her back, and he said to her: “Help yourself, chieftainess.” After she had put
them into [the basket] a while, and her basket was nearly full, he stepped upon a
stalk of łqeā′ma<a class="noteRef" id="n117.24src" href="#n117.24">25</a> which he had provided and said: “Ā-ā-ā, I feel my canoe cracking.” He then pushed
it from the land, and when she stretched out her arm for more [eulachon] he pulled
out the hairs under her armpit.
</p>
<p>Fern-woman (Snᴀndjā′ñ-djat) at once called for her sons. Both her sons knew how to
throw objects by means of a stick, they say.<a class="noteRef" id="n117.25src" href="#n117.25">26</a> He immediately fled. And one of them shot at him and broke his paddle. And after
they had broken ten he paddled with the one that had a knot hole. When they shot after
him again he said “Through the knot hole,” and through the knot hole went the stone.
Thus he was saved. He had dexterously got her armpit hair.
</p>
<p>He then left the canoe. He came to a shore opposite some people who were fishing with
fish rakes in Nass. And he said: “Hallo, <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>throw one over to me. I will give you light.” But they said: “Hᴀ hā′-ā-ā, he who is
speaking is the one who is always playing tricks.” He then let a small part shine
and put it away again. They forthwith emptied their canoe in front of him several
times.
</p>
<p>He then called a dog and said to it: “Shall I make (or ordain) four moons?” The dog
said that would not do. The dog wanted six. He (Raven) then said to him: “What will
you do when it is spring?” “When I am hungry I will move my feet in front of my face.”
And he made it as he (the dog) told him to do, they say.
</p>
<p>He then bit off a part of the moon. After he had chewed it for a while he threw it
up [into the sky]. “Future people are going to see you there in fragments forever.”
He then broke the moon into halves by throwing it down hard and threw [half of] it
up hard into the air, the sun as well.
</p>
<p>Thence he traveled northward. The smoke of House-point was near him. He then pulled
off his hair ribbon and threw one end of it over here. He at once ran across on it.
And he walked about the town, peering in [through the cracks]. The wife of the town
chief of House-point had given birth to a child. And he waited until evening. Then,
at the time when they went to bed, he entered [the child’s] skin and himself became
newly born.
</p>
<p>Every morning they washed him, and his father held him on his knee. After a while
his aunt came down to the fire. They handed him to his aunt. After she had held him
for a while he pinched her teats. “Ha′oia,” she said. “Why do you say that, ʟ̣a?”<a class="noteRef" id="n118.26src" href="#n118.26">27</a> “Why, he nearly fell from me.” The town chief was named “Hole-in-his-fin,” and his
nephew was named “Fin-turned-back.”
</p>
<p>After a while he thought: “I wish the village children would go picnicking.” And on
the next day the children of the town went picnicking. They brought along all sorts
of good food. And his aunt brought him to the same place. When they had played for
a while they went away. After they had all gone his aunt sat there alone. He looked
about, entered his own skin quickly, and seized his aunt. And his aunt said: “Do not
take hold of me. I am single because your father is going to eat my gifts.”<a class="noteRef" id="n118.27src" href="#n118.27">28</a>
</p>
<p>Then, as soon as she started off, he became a baby again. His aunt was crying and
as she went had it on her mind to tell what had happened. He wished his aunt would
forget it when she went in. And she went in. After her brother had looked at her a
while he asked: “What is the cause of those tear marks?” “Why, I discovered him eating
sand. That is why I am crying.”
</p>
<p>He then started along by the sea and, having punched holes in the shells brought up
by the tide, he made two dancing rattles. And he ran toward the woods. He took grave
mats, frayed out the ends, and fastened shells upon these. He made them into a dancing
skirt. And <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>he said to the ghost: “Are you awake?” It got up for him, and he tied the dancing
skirt upon it. He also put the rattle into its hand. And he said to it: “Walk in front
of the town. When you reach the middle wave the rattle in front of you toward the
houses. A deep sleep will fall then upon them.”
</p>
<p>Now it began to dance, they say. When it waved the rattle toward the town, just as
he had told it to do, they began to mumble in their sleep. They had nightmares. He
then went into the first house and, roughly pulling out a good-looking woman, lay
there with her. And he entered the next one. There, too, he lay with somebody. As
he went along doing this he entered his father’s house, went to where his aunt slept,
and lay with her.
</p>
<p>And a certain old woman living in the house corner did not have a nightmare. She had
been observing the chief’s son in the cradle come out of himself. Then he went out
again. After he had been away for a while he came in and lay down to sleep in the
cradle. He made the ghost lie down again.
</p>
<p>The town people told one another in whispers that he had lain with his aunt, and his
mother, Flood-tide-woman, as well. This went on for a while; then, all at once, there
was an outbreak. Then they drove Flood-tide-woman away with abusive language. Her
boy, too, they drove off with her with abusive words. She was the sister of Great-breakers,<a class="noteRef" id="n119.28src" href="#n119.28">29</a> belonging to the Strait people, they say.
</p>
<p>And they came along in this direction (i.e., toward Skidegate). After they had come
along for a while they found a young sea otter opposite the trail that runs across
Rose Spit (G̣o′łgustᴀ). His mother then skinned it and sewed it together. Now she
stretched it and, having scraped it, laid it out to dry. When it was dried she made
it into a blanket for her son. He was Nᴀñkî′lsʟ̣as-łiña′-i,<a class="noteRef" id="n119.29src" href="#n119.29">30</a> they say.
</p>
<p>And after they had traveled for a while she stood with her child in front of her brother’s
house. By and by somebody put his head out. “Ah, Flood-tide-woman stands without.”
“N-n-n, she has done as she always does (i.e., been unfaithful to her husband), and
for that reason comes back again,” said her brother. And again he spoke: “With her
is a boy. Come, come, come, let her in.”
</p>
<p>Then she came in with her son. And her brother’s wife gave them something to eat.
By and by he asked of her: “Flood-tide-woman, what are you going to name the child?”
And she moved her hand over the back of her head. She scratched it [in embarrassment].
“Why, I am going to name your nephew <span class="corr" id="xd32e22113" title="Source: Nᴀñki′lsʟas-łiña′-i">Nᴀñkî′lsʟas-łiña′-i</span>.” As she spoke she held back her words hesitatingly. “I tell you, name him differently,
lest the supernatural beings who are afraid to think of him (the bearer of that name)
hear that a common child is so called.”
</p>
<p>While she was staying with her brother her child walked about. He banged the swinging
door roughly. “Flood-tide-woman, stop that <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>child from continually opening the door in that way.” “Why, chief, I never can stop
him.” “Just hear what she says. What a common child is continually doing the supernatural
beings ever fear to do.” On another day, while Great-breakers was lying down, he banged
the door again. He said to the mother: “Flood-tide-woman, a common child is doing
the same thing again. Try to stop him.” “Why, chief, I can never stop your slave nephew.”
</p>
<p>And where he was sitting with his mother by the fire, on the side toward the door,
right there he defecated. And his uncle’s wife made a pooping sound at him. “I shall
indeed go with that husband’s nephew,” he heard his uncle’s wife say.<a class="noteRef" id="n120.30src" href="#n120.30">31</a>
</p>
<p>On the next day, very, very early in the morning, he started off. After he had gone
along for some time he came to some persons who burst into singing sweet songs and
danced. They then asked him: “Tell us, what are you doing hereabout?” “I am gathering
woman’s medicine.” “Well, what do you call woman’s medicine? Is woman’s medicine each
other’s medicine?” “Yes; it is each other’s medicine.” Those women chewed gum as they
sang. Then one of these gave him a piece. “This is woman’s medicine.” And one of them
gave him directions: “Now, when you enter the house, pass round to the right. Chew
the gum as you go in. And when your uncle’s wife asks it of you, by no means give
it to her. Ask of her the thing her husband owns. When it is in your hands give the
gum to her.” And he went away from the singers. When he entered the gum stuck out
red from his mouth. Then his uncle’s wife said to him: “I say, Nᴀñkî′lsʟas-łîña′-i,
come, give me the gum.” He paid no attention to her. He then sat down beside his mother,
and to his mother he said: “Tell her to give me the thing my uncle owns. I will then
give her the gum.” Then his mother went to her. She told it her. And to her she gave
something white and round. He then handed her the gum. While his uncle’s wife chewed
it and swallowed the juice he saw that her mind was changed.
</p>
<p>Some time after that his fathers<a class="noteRef" id="n120.31src" href="#n120.31">32</a> went by on the sea. And he said to a dog sitting near the door: “Nᴀñki′lsʟas-łîña′-i
says he desires the place where his fathers now are to dry up and leave them.” And
immediately it went out and said so. The tide left them high and dry, and they were
in great numbers. They made a scraping sound in their efforts to move. He then said
to his mother: “I say, go and pour water upon my fathers.” She then went down to them,
and she did not look upon her husband. She poured it only upon Fin-turned-back. And
he went to his mother and told her to pour water upon his father. She acted as if
she did not hear his voice. They were going to the supernatural beings of Da′osgên<a class="noteRef" id="n120.32src" href="#n120.32">33</a> to buy a whale, they say.
</p>
<p>Then he came in and said to the dog again: “Go and say, ‘Nᴀñkî′lsʟas-łîña′-i says
he desires the tide to come in to his parents.’ ” He then went out quickly and said
it. X̣ū-ū-ū-ū-ū (noise of the waves coming in), and they at once were moving along
far off on the water.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>And, after they had been gone a while, they returned to that place. And again he said
to the dog: “Go and say, ‘Nᴀñkî′lsʟas-łîña′-i says he wishes his parents to leave
something for him.’ ” He then went out quickly and said so. Something black was sent
to one end of the town. He went thither. A whale floated there.
</p>
<p>After he had made a house of hemlock boughs he shot all kinds of birds there. By and
by a bufflehead came and ate of the whale. He then wanted it. And he aimed just above
the top of its head. When it flew it struck its head. He then skinned it and entered
[the skin]. And he wished for a heavy swell, and it became rough, and he walked toward
the water. And when a wave came toward him he quickly dived under it. After he had
done the same thing repeatedly he flopped up from the water, took the skin off, and
dried it in his branch house. He thus came to own it, they say. He kept it in the
fork of a tree.
</p>
<p>After he had shot there all kinds of birds something blue and slender came and ate
of it. It flew down from above. It ate sitting upon it. He then shot it. He shot [only]
through its wings. He (Raven) was sad. And on the next day, early in the morning,
he entered his branch house. After he had sat there for a while it again came down
from above, making a noise as it came. And after it stood upon it and had begun to
eat he shot it. The arrow again passed quickly through its wings. His mind was sad.
</p>
<p>And on the next day, very early in the morning, he again went into the branch house.
It came by and by and ate. And he now shot over it. As it started to fly it was struck
in the head. He then went down to get it. He brought it into the branch house.
</p>
<p>When he had skinned it, he entered it. He then flew up. After he had flown for a while
he turned quickly and came down. He then ran his beak into a rocky point at the end
of the town. At the same time he cried out: “G̣ao” (Raven’s croak). Though the rock
was strong, he split it by his voice. After he had dried it in the branch house he
put it where he kept the bufflehead.
</p>
<p>He then started off, they say. He went in and sat down by the side of his mother.
By and by his aunt said to her husband: “Why do you remain seated so long? Go and
hunt,” she said to him. And they brought out a war spear and a box of arrows, and
they put pitch on [the cord wound round the arrow point] for him. And at midnight
he went off in a canoe, and his place was vacant in the morning.
</p>
<p>He (Raven) then went out and stood up out of himself (i.e., changed himself). He put
on two sky blankets and painted his face. And, as soon as he entered, his uncle’s
wife turned her head. He went around behind the screens. And, after some time had
passed, it thundered on the underground side of the island.
</p>
<p>And her husband came back and asked his wife: “My child’s mother, what noise was that,
sounding like the one that is heard when I go to <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>bed with you?” And she laughed and said: “Why, I guess I am the same with Nᴀñkî′lsʟas-łîña′-i,
your nephew.”
</p>
<p>On the next day, early in the morning, Great-breakers sat in the place where the fire
was. On the top of the chief’s hat (dadjî′ñ skîl) that he wore a round fleck of foam
swirled rapidly. Nᴀñkî′lsʟas-łîña′-i began to look around. And he went out, got his
two skins, put on his two sky blankets, and came in. His uncle had his hair tied in
two braids. Something on his head began turning around very rapidly.
</p>
<p>Then a strong current of sea water poured from the corner of the house. And he put
his mother in his armpit, quickly entered his bufflehead skin, and swam about in the
current. He dived many times and again swam about. And when the sea water came up
to the roof of the house he floated out with it through the smoke hole.
</p>
<p>He then quickly entered the raven’s skin. He at once flew up. He then ran his beak
into the sky. And his tail was afloat on the water. Then he kicked against the water.
“Enough. You, too, belong to me.” There it stopped (lit., “came to a point”). It began
to melt downward.
</p>
<p>And he looked down. The smoke of his uncle’s house looked pleasing. He then became
angry with him, at the sight, and started to fly down. After he had flown for a while
he ran his beak into it from above, crying as he did so, “G̣ao.” “Oh, you shall own
the title of Chief-of-chiefs (Kî′lsʟekun)” [said his uncle].
</p>
<p>He then became what he had been before. He entered with his mother. From that time
he often set out to hunt birds. When he came in one day he said to his mother: “Mother,
Qî′ñgi<a class="noteRef" id="n122.33src" href="#n122.33">34</a> says he is coming to adopt me.” And his uncle said to her: “Qꜝā′la īdjā′xᴀn,<a class="noteRef" id="n122.34src" href="#n122.34">35</a> Flood-tide-woman, stop that child from talking. We are, indeed, fit to be adopted.”
</p>
<p>After this had happened many times they saw something wonderful, they say. <span class="corr" id="xd32e22164" title="Source: Poeple">People</span> came dancing on ten canoes. He then went out, put on two sky blankets, and walked
around on the retaining planks. Said his uncle: “What he brought on by his talking
has happened. I wonder how we are going to supply people and food.”
</p>
<p>And, after he had walked about for a while, he kicked upon the ground in the front
part of the house on the right side. There the ground cracked open. Out of it one
threw up a drum from his shoulder. They came pouring out. He went to the other side
as well. There he also kicked. “Earth, even, become people” [he said]. Thence, too,
one threw up a drum from his shoulder. And he did the same thing to the ground in
one of the rear corners. Out of that, too, some one threw up a drum from his shoulder.
He did as before on the other side. And they danced in four lines toward the beach.
Out of his uncle’s house Tsimshian, Haida, Kwakiutl, Tlingit [came] <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>singing different songs.<a class="noteRef" id="n123.35src" href="#n123.35">36</a> Yet his uncle said [sarcastically]: “We shall indeed have lots to eat.” They sat
down in lines, and around the door was a crowd to serve the food.
</p>
<p>Then <span class="corr" id="xd32e22176" title="Source: Nᴀñki′lsʟas-łiña′-i">Nᴀñkî′lsʟas-łîña′-i</span> said: “Now go to my sister Sî′ndjugwañ to get food for me.”<a class="noteRef" id="n123.36src" href="#n123.36">37</a> And a crowd of young men went to get it. They came back with silver salmon and cranberries.
And [he said]: “Go to Yał-kīñā′ñg̣o,<a class="noteRef" id="n123.37src" href="#n123.37">38</a> too, to beg some for me.” Her house was also full of silver salmon, cranberries,
and sockeye salmon. They also brought some from the woman at the head of Skidegate
creek,<a class="noteRef" id="n123.38src" href="#n123.38">39</a> and they brought some from the woman at the head of Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o creek. It mounted
up level with the roof. The distribution of food was still going on when daylight
came. On the next day, too, and on the next day [it went on]. At the end of ten days
they went off in a crowd. These [days] were ten winters, they say.
</p>
<p>And he went off with his father Qî′ñgi. Soon after they arrived at his village he
invited the people to come. He called them for a feast. He (Nᴀñkî′lsʟas) did not eat
the smallest bit. And on the next day he called them in to a feast for his son. Again
he did not eat. Two big-bellied fellows had come in. People took up cranberries by
the box, and when one of these opened his mouth they emptied a boxful into it. They
also emptied boxes into the mouth of the other.
</p>
<p>On the next day his father invited them again, and they (the big-bellies) came in
and stood there. And again cranberries were emptied into their mouths. Then Nᴀñkî′lsʟas
went quickly toward the end of the town. As he was going along he came to open ground
where cranberries were being blown out. He stopped up this hole with moss, and he
did the same to another. After he had entered he questioned the big-bellied ones,
who stood near the door: “I say, tell me the reason why you eat [so much].” “Don’t
ask it, chief. We are always afflicted in this way.” “Yes; tell me. When my father
calls in the people, and you are going to eat, if you do not tell me I will make you
always full.” “Well, chief, sit close to me while I tell you. Early in the morning
take a bath, and when you lie down [after it] scratch yourself over your heart, and
when scabs have formed on the next day swallow them.”
</p>
<p>He did at once as he was told. After he had sat still for a while [he said]: “Father,
I have become hungry.” Upon this his father sent to call the people. [The big-bellied
persons] again came in and stood there. Again was [food] emptied into their mouths.
It did them no good. And he again became hungry. He again called them in. Day after
day, for many days, he called them in. One day he went out [to defecate]. They saw
him eating the cranberries that had floated ashore upon the beach [from peoples’ dung].
Thereupon they shut the door upon him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>He now started off. By and by he came [back] and sat behind his father’s house. “Father,
please let me in.” They did not want him. “Father, please let me in. I will put grizzly
bears upon you. I will put mountain goats upon you.”<a class="noteRef" id="n124.39src" href="#n124.39">40</a> He offered him all the mainland animals. “No, chief, my son, they might wake me up
by walking over me.”
</p>
<p>He then began to sing a certain song. He beat time by striking his head against the
house. The house began to fall over. And at that time he nearly let him in, they say.
And when he went away they snatched off from him the black bear and marten [skins]
he wore.
</p>
<p>That time he went away for a long period. By and by they saw him floating on the sea
in front of the town in a hair-seal canoe.<a class="noteRef" id="n124.40src" href="#n124.40">41</a> He wore his uncle’s hat. On top of it the foam was swirling around as he floated.
As soon as they saw he had become changed in some unknown manner the town people all
entered Qîñgi’s house. And after they had talked over what they should do for a while
he dressed himself up. The town people put themselves between the joints of his tall
hat. After <span class="corr" id="xd32e22211" title="Source: Nañkî′lsʟas">Nᴀñkî′lsʟas</span> had remained there a while the sea water continued to increase. And Qîñgi, too, grew
up. Then he became angry and broke the hat by pulling it downward. Half the people
of his town were lost.
</p>
<p>After he had been gone for a while he came and stopped in front of the town. “Nᴀñkî′lsʟas
is in front on a canoe.” And his father said: “Go and get him that I may see his face.”
They then spread out mats, and his comrades came in and sat there. His father continually
gave him food. His father was glad to see him.
</p>
<p>After food had been given out for a long time and evening was come, his father sat
down near the door. By and by he said: “My son, chief’s child, let one of your companions
tell me a story.” He then asked the one who sat next to him: “Don’t you know a story?”<a class="noteRef" id="n124.41src" href="#n124.41">42</a> “No,” they all said, and he turned in the other direction also. “Don’t you know one
story?” “No; we do not.” He then said to his father: “They do not know any stories.”
And his father, Qîñgi, said, “Ītꜝē′i, let one of your companions relate to me ‘Raven
traveling,’ ” by which he made Nᴀñkî′lsʟas so ashamed that he hung his head.
</p>
<p>By and by, lo, a small, dark person, who sat on the right side, threw himself backward
where he sat. “Ya-yā′-ō-ō-ō-ō-ō, the village of the master of stories, Qîñgi.” When
he said this the people in the house were [startled], as if something were thrown
down violently. “Ya-yā′-ō-ō-ō-ō-ō, the supernatural beings came to look at a ten-jointed
łqeā′ma<a class="noteRef" id="n124.42src" href="#n124.42">43</a> growing in front of the village of the master of stories, Qîñgi. There they were
destroyed.” “Ya-yā′-ō-ō-ō-ō-ō, the supernatural beings came and looked at a rainbow<a class="noteRef" id="n124.43src" href="#n124.43">44</a> (a story name) moving up and down in front of the village of the master of stories,
Qîñgi. There they were destroyed [said the next].” “Ya-yā′-ō-ō-ō-ō-ō, the supernatural
<span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>beings once came to look at Greatest-sea-gull and Greatest-white-crested-cormorant
throw a whale’s tail back and forth on a reef that first came up in front of Qîñgi’s
town. There they were destroyed.” “Ya-yā′-ō-ō-ō-ō-ō, the supernatural beings came
to see Harlequin-duck and Blue-jay run a race with each other on the property of the
master of stories, Qîñgi. There they were destroyed.” “Ya-yā′-ō-ō-ō-ō-ō, the supernatural
beings once came to look at the lower section of a wooden rattle lying around which
used to sing of itself.<a class="noteRef" id="n125.44src" href="#n125.44">45</a> There they were lost.” “Ya-yā′-ō-ō-ō-ō-ō, the supernatural beings once came to look
at an inlet, which broke suddenly through white rocks at the end of Qîñgi’s town,
out of which Djila′qons came knitting. There they were destroyed.” “Ya-yā′-ō-ō-ō-ō-ō,
the supernatural beings once came to see Tā′dᴀlᴀt-g̣ā′dᴀla and Marten run a race with
each other in front of the village of the master of stories, Qîñgi. There they were
destroyed.” [What the other three said has been forgotten.<a class="noteRef" id="n125.45src" href="#n125.45">46</a>]
</p>
<p>Then Nᴀñkî′lsʟas started off afoot. After he had traveled for a while he came to the
town of Ku′ndji. In front of it many canoes floated. They were fishing for flounders.<a class="noteRef" id="n125.46src" href="#n125.46">47</a> They used for bait salmon roe that had been put up in boxes. He then desired some,
and changed himself into a flounder. And he went out. After he had been stealing the
salmon roe for a while they pulled out his beak.
</p>
<p>Those people, who then sat gambling in rows in the town, looked at the beak one after
another. They handed it back and forth for the purpose. Nᴀñkî′lsʟas looked at it,
and said: “It is made of salmon roe.” He then went toward the woods and called Screech-owl.
And he pulled its beak out, put it upon himself, and put some common thing into [the
owl] in its stead.
</p>
<p>By and by they went out again to fish and again he went out. And after he had jerked
off many pieces of salmon roe a hook entered one of his lips. They then pulled him
to the surface and came ashore, and [the owner] gave it to his child, and they ran
a stick through it [to put it over the fire]. And when his back became too warm he
thought: “I wish something would make them run over toward the end of the town.” After
some time had passed the whole town (i.e., the people of the town) suddenly moved.
And right before the child, who sat alone near by, he put on his feather clothing
and flew out through the smoke hole. The child then called to its mother: “My food
flew away, mother.”
</p>
<p>He did not go away from the town, they say. On another day they prepared some food
in the morning. Crow invited the people to a feast of cakes made of the inner bark
of the hemlock and cranberries mixed together. Among them they called him (Raven).
And he refused. “No; you only call each other for mussels.” Afterward he sent Eagle
out to see what they did call each other for. And after <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>he had gone thither he said to him: “They call each other for cakes of hemlock bark
and cranberries<span class="corr" id="xd32e22256" title="Not in source">.</span>” “Now, cousin, be my messenger.” Eagle then said: “The chief is coming.” “No; we
call each other for mussels.”
</p>
<p>Before they had begun eating he ran into the woods. After he had made rotten trees
into ten canoes he put in spruce cones, standing them up along the middle. Grass tops
he put into their hands for spears. They then came around the point, and he walked
near them with his blanket wrapped tightly around him. Terrible to behold, they came
around the point, men standing in lines along the middle of the canoes. Leaving their
food, the people fled at once. He then went into the house and ate the cakes. He ate.
He ate. Where the canoes landed they were washed about by the waves.
</p>
<p>He then started off. He traveled about. On the way he got his sister neatly, they
say. He then left his sister with his wife. And he started off by canoe. He begged
Snowbird<a class="noteRef" id="n126.47src" href="#n126.47">48</a> to go along with him, and took him for company. He also took along a spear. And short
objects<a class="noteRef" id="n126.48src" href="#n126.48">49</a> lay one upon another on a certain reef. Then, when they came near to it, the bird
became different.<a class="noteRef" id="n126.49src" href="#n126.49">50</a> He took him back. And he begged Blue-jay also to go, and he started with him. But
when they got near he, too, flapped his wings helplessly in the canoe. And, after
he had tried all creatures in vain, he made a drawing on a toadstool with a stick,
placed it in the stern, and said to it: “Bestir yourself and reverse the stroke” [to
stop the canoe]. He then started off with him. But when he got near it shook its head
[so strong was the influence].
</p>
<p>He then speared a big one and a small one and took them back. And when he came home
he called his wife and placed the thing he had gone for upon her. And he put one upon
his sister as well. Then Sīwa′s (his sister) cried, and he said to her: “But yours
will be safe.”<a class="noteRef" id="n126.50src" href="#n126.50">51</a>
</p>
<p>After he left that place he married Cloud-woman. And, as Cloud-woman had predicted,
a multitude of salmon came up for him. But, when they were on the point of moving
and he went through the middle passage of the smokehouse, salmon bones stuck in his
hair, and he used bad language that made his wife angry.<a class="noteRef" id="n126.51src" href="#n126.51">52</a> She then said to the dog salmon: “Swim away.” From all the places where they lay
they began to swim off. And a box of salmon roe on which his sister sat was the only
food left in the house.
</p>
<p>They then moved the camp empty-handed. And he made himself sick. He went along in
the bow beside the salmon roe. After he had gone along for a while his sister smelt
something, and he said it was a scab he had pulled off with his finger nails. After
she had spoken about it many times as they went along he threw Sīwa′s’s box empty
ashore.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>And after they had gone along for a while they built a camp fire. He then put yellow
cedar upon the fire. After it had given forth sparks for a while one flew between
Sīwa′s’s legs. He then told her a remedy: “Now, go around in the woods exclaiming,
‘I call for medicine.’ When something says ‘Yes,’ go over to it and sit down where
a short red thing sticks up.” And after he had spoken to her, and she had called about
for a while, something said “Yes.” And after she had looked for it [she saw] something
red sticking up. Then she sat down there. Lo, she discovered her brother lying on
the ground under her.
</p>
<p>He then became ashamed, and drew something with the tip of his finger. Right there
a child cried. And he took it out [of the ground]. And he put boards round it as people
were going to do in the future. Then the child became old enough to play. And he went
around after [the child]. One time when it went out to play it vanished forever.
</p>
<p>Then he started to search for it. He put on his feather clothing and flew over the
whole of this country. He did the same upon Mainland. When he could by no means find
it, he heard that the supernatural beings had taken it because he (Raven) used to
fool them. He then stopped searching. When the boy stood up, lightning used to flash
around his <span class="corr" id="xd32e22288" title="Source: kneejoints">knee-joints</span>. He was named Sᴀqaiyū′ł.
</p>
<p>One day some one with disheveled hair came in. “Father, I come in to you.” Then he
(Raven) spat upon his face. “Sᴀqaiyū′ł was not like that.” And when he went out, lightning
played around his knee-joints. He vanished at once. Then he cried; he cried.
</p>
<p>Then he put his sister into his armpit and started off with her. And after Siwa′s
had finished her planting at Ramsey island he came, stood on the inner side of Ramsey
island, and begged all kinds of birds to accompany him. They went after cedar-bark
roofing in preparation for a potlatch. They soon got this out upon the open ground.
He then caused the cedar bark to be left there.<a class="noteRef" id="n127.52src" href="#n127.52">53</a>
</p>
<p>And, when they became hungry, he called all kinds of animals. And, after they came
floating in front of him on their canoes, he came out wearing black, shabby clothing.
He then spoke. They did not understand. And they sent for Porpoise-woman. And when
she came he (Raven) said: “I am the sides and I am the ends, between which I qᴀlaastī′s.”<a class="noteRef" id="n127.53src" href="#n127.53">54</a> Then she said: “How would they get along if I were absent? He wants them to fight
him with abalones and sea eggs.” They then threw these at him. And he ate. And, since
the house was too small, he started to potlatch outside. All the supernatural beings
whom he had invited came by canoe.
</p>
<p>Then he made holes in the beaks of all kinds of birds. And Eagle, too, asked to have
his pierced. He became wearied by his importunities and made them anyhow. That is
why his nasal openings now run upward.

</p>
<p>When he first started he decked out the birds. They were made of different varieties,
as they now appear to us, in one house. Then, as soon as he had dressed up the birds,
they went out together. At that time he refused to adorn two of them. When the house
was too full they said to those who sat next to the walls: “Let your heads be as thin
as the place where you sit.” Those have thin heads.
</p>
<p>The two he had refused to adorn went crying to the [various] supernatural beings and
came to Rose Spit, where they heard a drum sound toward the woods. They went thither.
When they came and stood before Master Carpenter<a class="noteRef" id="n128.54src" href="#n128.54">55</a> with tear marks on their faces, he asked: “What causes your tear marks?” They then
answered: “Raven<a class="noteRef" id="n128.55src" href="#n128.55">56</a> decked out the other birds. He said we were not worth adorning.” “And yet you are
going to be handsomer than all others” [he said], and, having let them in, he painted
them up. He put designs on their skins (feathers). Those were the Qꜝē′da-kꜝō′­xawa.<a class="noteRef" id="n128.56src" href="#n128.56">57</a>

</p>
<p>He went thence by canoe, and came to where herring had been spawning. He then filled
the canoe with herring, dipped them out of the place where the bilge water settles
and threw them toward the shore. “Future people will not see the place where you are.”<a class="noteRef" id="n128.57src" href="#n128.57">58</a>

<p class="center">[Continued by the chief of Kloo of Those-born-at-Skedans]
</p>
<p>And when he went away he came to where a spider crab sat. And he said to it: “Comrade,
do you sit here? Don’t you know that we used to play together as children?” He then
put his wings into its mouth and took them out again. “A little farther off, spider
crab,” he said to it, and it closed its jaws together. It began at once to move seaward.
And he (Raven) said to it: “Comrade, let me go. When about to let me go you used to
look at me with eyes partly closed [as you are doing] now. Let me go. It will be better
for us to play with each other differently. Let me go.” By and by the sea water flowed
over him. Then it let him go.
</p>
<p>And after he had traveled for a while he pulled off leaves from the salal-berry bushes,
stuck spruce needles into them, and came to where an old man lay with his back to
the fire. And he entered and sat down on the side opposite him. “Hē,” he said, as
if he, too, were cold from going after something. Then the old man looked over to
him and said: “Have I stretched out my legs, that one keeps saying he is getting cold?”
He then stretched out his legs, and it became low tide. And, with Eagle, he brought
up sea eggs to the woods. [Raven also brought up a red cod, but Eagle brought up a
black cod.]
</p>
<p>They then made a camp fire. And Eagle roasted his.<a class="noteRef" id="n128.58src" href="#n128.58">59</a> It began to drop fat into the fire. Then Raven roasted his, but it became dry. <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>And he asked to taste of Eagle’s. “Cousin, why does yours taste like cedar? Cousin,
I will bring you a small bundle of bark from the woods. When a stump comes to you,
rub this [black cod] upon its face.” As soon as he went off Eagle put some stones
into the fire. When they became red-hot, the stump came toward him. He then picked
up a stone with the tongs and rubbed it upon the stump, and the stump went back into
the woods out of sight. By and by, lo, he came to him with bark on his shoulder. His
face was blackened all over. “Why, cousin, what has happened to your face?” “Well,
cousin, I pulled some bark down upon my face.” “Why, cousin, it is as if something
had burned it.” “No, indeed, cousin, bark dropped upon me.”
</p>
<p class="center">[Continued by John Sky]
</p>
<p>On the way from this place he begged for canoe companions.<a class="noteRef" id="n129.59src" href="#n129.59">60</a> He begged all kinds of birds to come. Then Blue-jay offered himself to him, and he
said: “No: you are too old to come.” But he insisted. He then seized him by the top
of his head and pulled him into the canoe. For that reason the top of his head is
flattish. And he completed his begging for comrades.
</p>
<p>They all got then into the canoe. And it set off. It went. It went. It went. It went.
They stopped in front of the Halibut people. Hu-hu-hu-hu-hu,<a class="noteRef" id="n129.60src" href="#n129.60">61</a> they came down to the beach in crowds. “Raven is going to war,” they said one to
another as they came down to meet him. And he asked them to go, too, as companions,
and they went. They fixed themselves along the bottom of the canoe like skids<a class="noteRef" id="n129.61src" href="#n129.61">62</a> and started. They went. They went. And before daylight they landed at the end of
his (the enemy’s) town. Then his Halibut people lay [in two rows], with their heads
outward, along the path which extended down from the house. Outside of them the birds
also stood in lines. They hid themselves behind the halibut. After they had been there
a while he came out wearing his dancing hat. When he came out one of the halibut flopped
his tail at him. He fell down. The next one, too, wriggled his tail. So they continued
to do until they brought him in.<a class="noteRef" id="n129.62src" href="#n129.62">63</a> Then he asked them why they did this to him. And they said they did it because he
blew too long. They then let him go. And they started back. This was Southeast-wind,
they say. After they had gone along for a while they set down the halibut at their
homes, and the birds also went away.
</p>
<p>And after he had traveled about for a while he came to some children playing and offered
to join them. “I say-y-y, playing children, let me play with you-ou-ou.” “No-o-o;
you would eat all of our hair <span class="corr" id="xd32e22359" title="Source: se-e-e al">se-e-e-al</span>.” And he said: “My grandfather has gone after some for me. My father has gone after
some for me.” They then let him play with them. Then he devoured all of the children’s
hair seals, and they were all crying for them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>He also started away from that place. After he had gone along for a while he found
a flicker’s feather floating near the shore and said to it: “Become a flicker.” It
at once flapped its wings.
</p>
<p>And after he had traveled thence for a while he came to the place where Master Fisherman<a class="noteRef" id="n130.63src" href="#n130.63">64</a> and his wife lived. He wanted Raven’s flicker; so he gave it to him. “Things like
this are found on an island that I own.” And he said he would show it to him. And
after he said he would show it to him Master Fisherman baited a halibut hook taken
from among those hanging in bunches on the wall. When he had let it down into the
hole into which they used to vomit sea water he pulled out a halibut, and his wife
split it open and steamed it. When it was cooked the three ate it.
</p>
<p>They went to bed, and next day he took him (Master Fisherman) to see the flicker island.
Then he arrived there and said to Master Fisherman: “Do not get off.” Then he (Raven)
landed. He broke off the ends of cedar limbs. And he wounded his nose. As he went
along he let the blood run down into his hands. And he threw around the cedar twigs
with blood upon them. “Change to flickers,” he repeated. Then they flew in a flock.
And he brought some in. “Now, get off. There are plenty of them,” he said to him.
Then he landed.
</p>
<p class="center">[Continued by the Chief of Kloo.]
</p>
<p>And he (Raven) lay down in the canoe and began to drift away with the wind, and he
(Master Fisherman) shouted to him: “Say, you are drifting away. You are drifting away.”
He paid no attention to him.<a class="noteRef" id="n130.64src" href="#n130.64">65</a> He got far off. Then he started away [by paddling]. Then he made himself appear like
Master Fisherman, and landed in front of his wife’s [house]. And he said: “Behold,
it was the one always doing such things. There is not a sign of the things he went
to show me.” And after he had had her as his wife a while he said: “My child’s mother,
differently from my former state, I am hungry.” Then she steamed a fat halibut for
him, and he ate it. After he had remained sitting for a while, he said: “My child’s
mother, differently from my former state, I would like it.”<a class="noteRef" id="n130.65src" href="#n130.65">66</a> Then he again drank salt water. And after he had drunk salt water he baited the halibut
hook and let it down into the hole where sea water was vomited out. The same thing
as before happened. He pulled a halibut out.
</p>
<p>And when his wife went after some water, lo, her husband sat near the creek and said
to her: “That was the same one who is always doing such things. Stop all the holes
in the house. As soon as he drifted away from it (the island) I wished my hair-seal
club would swim over to me.” And to him it swam out. Then it brought him to the land,
they say.
</p>
<p>Then he ran in with the hair-seal club. And he (Raven) ran squawking about the house.
By and by he knocked him down with <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>his club. Then he threw him down into the latrine. And after he had lain there a while
he spoke up out of it.<a class="noteRef" id="n131.66src" href="#n131.66">67</a> Then he took him out and pounded him up again. He even pounded up his bones. And
he went down to the beach at low tide and rolled a big rock over upon him.
</p>
<p>[End of so-called “old man’s story” and beginning of “young man’s” part<a class="noteRef" id="n131.67src" href="#n131.67">68</a>]
</p>
<p>Then he was nearly covered by the tide. And he changed himself in different ways.
By and by, when only his beak showed above water, his ten supernatural helpers came
to him. Then they rolled the rock off from him, and he drifted away. The first to
smell him among his supernatural helpers was a Tlingit, who wore a bone in his nose
[like the shamans.]
</p>
<p>After he had drifted away for a while, some people came along in a canoe. “Why does
the chief float about upon the water?” And when they got within a short distance he
said: “He has a hard time for going after a woman.”
</p>
<p>And after he had drifted about a while longer, a black whale came along blowing. And
he thought, “I wish it would swallow me.” And, as he wished, it swallowed him. Then
he ate up its insides. After he had eaten all he thought: “I wish it would drift ashore
with me in front of a town.” And in front of a town it drifted ashore with him.
</p>
<p>After they had spent some time in cutting it up, they cut a hole through right where
he was, and he flew out. Then he flew straight up. And he turned down at the end of
the town, pulled off the skin of an old man living there, threw away his bones, went
into his skin, and lived in his place instead of him. By and by they asked him about
the something that came out of the whale’s belly. Then he said: “When something similar
happened a long time ago they fled from each other in fear.” At once they fled from
each other in fear. And afterward he ate the whale they were bringing up. This was
why he had changed himself.
</p>
<p class="center">[Told by Tom Stevens, chief of Those-born-at-House-Point.]
</p>
<p>And one time he had Hair-seal as his wife. Then they had a child. And one day he went
after firewood with him. His son was fat, and, pleased at the sight of him, he wanted
to eat him. Then he said to him: “I am within a little of eating you.” And after they
had come home, and had got through eating, he said to his mother: “Ha ha⁺, mama, my
father said to me: ‘I am within a little of eating you.’ ” And Raven said: “Stop the
child.” He made him ashamed. After that he devoured him.<a class="noteRef" id="n131.68src" href="#n131.68">69</a>
</p>
<p class="center">[Continued by the Chief of Kloo.]
</p>
<p>And after he had traveled about a while from that place he came to another town. And
he was eating the leavings cut off of the salmon they brought in. By and by some of
the milt<a class="noteRef" id="n131.69src" href="#n131.69">70</a> hung out of his <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>nose. Then he said to his cousin [Eagle]: “When I pass in front of the town, cousin,
say: ‘Wā-ā-ā<a class="noteRef" id="n132.70src" href="#n132.70">71</a>, one goes along in front of the town with a weasel hanging from his nose.’ ” And
when he passed in front of the village [he said], “Wā-ā-ā, one passes in front of
the town with the milt of a salmon hanging from his nose.” Then he went back to him
and said: “Cousin, say, ‘Weasel, weasel.’ ” But when he went again he said the same
thing. Then he made him ashamed, and he went right along [without stopping].
</p>
<p>And after he had gone along for a while he met some people coming back from the hunt
with many hair seals. Then he changed himself into a woman. And he found a long, slender
rock and said to it: “Change into a child,” and it became a human being. “Say, you
who are coming, come and marry me.” Then the canoe was pointed toward her. And she
picked up stones, too, they say. After they had gone along for a while she said: “The
child wants hair seal. He is crying for it.” Then one cut off a piece for it. Then
she wished a mist to fall, and it happened. Then they put mats over her, under which
she ate it. And she put grease on the stones and threw them overboard. And she kept
saying that it was the hair seal. Then they gave some to her again.
</p>
<p>Then they gave her as wife to one of them. Some time after he had married her they
gave her salmon roe to eat. And she saw where they kept it. Then she went to the place
at night. And she ate in it. But when she lay down afterward she found that her labret
was lost. And when they went [to the box] to get some again in the morning they found
her labret in it. Upon this she touched it quickly with her lips and said: “Lg̣ᴀ′nsal
stā′-is<a class="noteRef" id="n132.71src" href="#n132.71">72</a> was flapping her wings all night in my lip as she always does when she wants something
that smells bad.” Then they handed it to her, and she put it back into her lip.
</p>
<p>And one day, when she went out with others to defecate, and stood up, the tail coming
from her buttocks was visible a moment. “Ai-ī, what is that sticking from my son’s
wife’s buttocks?” “Why, this is not the first time a Tlingit woman’s tail stuck out
from her buttocks.”
</p>
<p>By and by she told her husband they were about to come after her, and she made them
bring together firewood in preparation for it. Then she changed excrement into people
and made them come by canoe. Then they landed; but when they came in and sat down
they began to perspire. Right there they were melted. And she became ashamed. Then
they were completely melted. And she flew away.
</p>
<p>And after he (Raven) had traveled on from that place he came to where Water-ousel<a class="noteRef" id="n132.72src" href="#n132.72">73</a> lived. And he (the bird) gave him food. By and by he drove a stick into his leg,
out of which salmon roe [such as has lain some days after hatching] ran in a stream.
He gave it to him to eat. Then he started from that place. After he had traveled <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>for a while he came to where Sea-lion lived. And after he had given him some food
he roasted his hand, out of which grease dropped. That he gave him to eat. He started
off, and when he had traveled a while came to where Hair-seal lived. Then he, too,
roasted his hand in the fire, and grease came out. He gave it to him to eat.
</p>
<p>Then he went away and lived in one place for a while. After he had lived there for
a time Water-ousel came in to him. Then he drove something into his leg, but only
made himself faint away. And he (the bird) was ashamed. While he was in the faint
he went off. Then he came to himself. And after he had continued living there for
a while Sea-lion and Hair-seal came in.<a class="noteRef" id="n133.73src" href="#n133.73">74</a> Then he roasted his hand, but it was burned. And they left him. Afterward he came
to life again.
</p>
<p>[Parts of the young man’s story told by Walter McGregor of the Qā′-i-ał-lā′nas]
</p>
<p>He began to offer his sister in marriage, and when any creature came in to him he
looked at its buttocks. When they were lean he refused it. After he had done [lit.,
said] this for a while Sea-lion wanted to many his sister. Then he looked at his buttocks.
They were fat, and he let him marry his sister. They had two children. G̣ē′noa<a class="noteRef" id="n133.74src" href="#n133.74">75</a> was the elder. Iwā′ldjida was the younger. Once Raven went out fishing with his brother-in-law
and thought: “I wish halibut would come to me only.” Then he only caught halibut.
And his brother-in-law, Sea-lion, asked him: “Say, why do they come to you?” “That
is something people are not brave enough to ask for.” Then he again asked him, and
he said to him: “Well, they like me, because I use a piece of skin cut from my testes
for bait.” And he told him to do the same to his. When he just touched them with a
knife, “Wā-wa-wa-wā′, it hurts,” he said to him. “Don’t you see you are not brave
enough for it?” Then he told him to do as before. Then he cut off the whole of his
testes and ate the fat part of his brother-in-law. After he had consumed it he put
stones in him in its place, and came to his sister singing a crying song: “Siwa′s’s
husband, my sister’s husband. Siwa′s’s husband, my sister’s husband.” Then his sister
asked him: “What has happened, brother?” He paid no attention to her. He sang the
crying song. “What is it?” she kept saying. By and by she asked her brother: “What
has happened, my brother Raven?” And he said to her: “Where they always do so, [the
enemy] stood at House-point. With my great brother-in-law I met them. My great brother-in-law
fell without speaking a word. I, however, went around and around them calling.” Then
his sister, too, sang a crying song. She had G̣ē′noa on her back and held Iwā′ldjida
in her hands. Then she sang the crying song: “G̣ē′noa’s father, Iwā′ldjida’s father.
G̣ē′noa’s father, Iwā′ldjida’s father.” At once they carried him up in a mat. And
Siwa′s said: “Say, chief, <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>why is your brother-in-law so heavy?” Then Raven said: “You always talk nonsense.
This is not the first time a chief who has been killed is heavy.” The rocks put into
him made him heavy.
</p>
<p>After they got him into the house they had Mallard-duck<a class="noteRef" id="n134.75src" href="#n134.75">76</a> doctor him, and when he came in, and had gone around the fire for a while, he said:
“Hă<sup>n</sup> hă<sup>n</sup> hă<sup>n</sup> hă<sup>n</sup> (quacking of duck), his brother-in-law, his brother-in-law.” And Raven said: “[Speak]
differently, great doctor. [Speak] differently.” Then again he said, “Hă<sup>n</sup> hă<sup>n</sup> hă<sup>n</sup> hă<sup>n</sup>, his brother-in-law took out his insides.” Then he kicked him into the fire. And
just before he flew out he said the same thing. So they came to know that he had killed
his brother-in-law.
</p>
<p>One time he let Cormorant marry Siwa′s, because he was the best fisherman. And he
went out fishing with him, and Cormorant alone caught halibut. He (Raven) caught only
a small one. Then he went toward the bow to Cormorant and said to him: “Let me see
what is upon your tongue.” And when he ran his tongue out he pulled it out, and his
voice was gone. That is why the cormorant has no voice.
</p>
<p>Then he pulled the halibut round toward himself [so that their heads lay in his direction]
and turned the small one toward him (Cormorant).<a class="noteRef" id="n134.76src" href="#n134.76">77</a> Then they went home, and he pulled off the halibut. Cormorant motioned his wife to
the halibut, and his sister asked: “Say, chief, why does he motion me to the halibut?”
Then Raven said: “He is trying to say he wants the head of a big one.” And she asked
her brother again: “Say, chief, what has happened to your brother-in-law?” “Why, while
I was fishing with him his voice left him.” He wanted to eat all the halibut. That
is why he took it out.
</p>
<p>After he had gone on for some distance a sea anemone (?) looked out from under a rock.
He became fascinated at the sight of the corners of its eyes, which were bluish, and
said to it: “Say, cousin, come and let me kiss you.” And the sea anemone said: “I
know your words, Raven,” and made him angry. Then he threw aside the stones from it
and steamed it [in the ground]. When it was cooked he ate it while it was still hot.
Then his heart was burst with the burning. That is why ravens do not eat sea anemones.
</p>
<p>After he had gone along from there for a while he came to a town. Having looked into
the house [he saw] no people there. Then he entered. Halibut and slices of smoked
hair seal lay on the drying frame. Only old wedges lay near the fire. But when he
started to carry off the halibut and slices of seal a wedge threw itself at his ankle
bone; on the other side the same thing happened, and he fainted with the pain. Then
he threw them from his shoulders and went out. And he looked into a house near by.
And he entered that, too. There were plenty of hair seals and halibut there. On the
wall was some design drawn with finger nails. Then he started to carry some out. When
he came to the door something pulled his hair. He saw <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>nothing. After they had pulled his hair until they made him weak, he went out. These
were the Shadow people, they say.
</p>
<p>After he had traveled thence for a while he came to a house in which the Herring people
were dancing. The air (weather or sky)<a class="noteRef" id="n135.77src" href="#n135.77">78</a> even shook above them. And when he looked in the Herring people spawned upon his
mustache. Then he ate the fish eggs. They tasted bad, and he threw away his mustache.<a class="noteRef" id="n135.78src" href="#n135.78">79</a> Then, having pushed in a young hemlock he had broken off, he drew it out. The fish
eggs were thick upon it, and he ate them. They tasted good. He started the use [of
these limbs].
</p>
<p>After he had gone on for a while he came to one who had a fire in his house. And he
did not know how to get his live coals. And [the man] had bought a deerskin. “Say,
cousin, I want to borrow your skin a while.” And he lent it to him. It had a long
tail, they say, and he tied a bundle of pitch wood to the end of the tail. Then he
came in and danced before him. As he danced his face was turned toward the fire only.
After he had danced for a time he struck his tail into the fire and the pitch wood
burned. Then his tail was burned off. That is why the deer’s tail is short. Then he
went into his own skin and flew away with the live coals. His beak, too, was burned
off. And they pursued him. They could not catch him and came back. He got the coals
neatly.
</p>
<p>On traveling thence he found a devilfish’s nose (i.e., mouth) drifted ashore. And
he took it and came to Screech-owl. And he said to him: “Say, cousin, let me borrow
your beak a while,” and he lent it to him. Then he stuck the devilfish nose he had
found in its place and said to him: “Say, cousin, yours looks nice. You are fit to
travel about with the supernatural beings.”
</p>
<p>After he had traveled on for a while his cousin (Eagle) came to him. And, after they
had traveled together for a while they came to an abundance of berries, which Eagle
consumed before he got there. On that account he was angry with him. And he went quickly
to the beach, found a sharp fish bone, and stuck it into the moss ahead of him (Eagle).
“Run into Eagle’s foot,” he said to the bone. And he said to Eagle: “Now, cousin,
go right on here before me.” And as he went along there the bone stuck into his foot.
“Cousin, let me see it,” and he pretended to take it out with his teeth, but instead
commenced to push it in farther. “Wā-wā-wā, cousin, you are pushing it in.” “No, cousin,
it is because I am trying to pull it out with my teeth.” By and by he pulled it out
and said to him: “Cousin, wait right here.” Then he examined the ground before him
[to select an easy path]. And he ordered a chasm to form. It did so. And, breaking
off a stalk of łqeā′ma,<a class="noteRef" id="n135.79src" href="#n135.79">80</a> he laid it across the gulf and put moss upon it. He made it like a dead, fallen tree.
Then he went back toward Eagle, carried him on his back, and started over with <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>him upon the dead tree. When he got halfway over he let him go. “Yauwaiyā′, what I
carry on my back is heavy.” He burst open below. Then he went down to him and ate
his berries. He ate all and started off.
</p>
<p>After he had traveled for a while he came to a woman with a good-sized labret weaving
a water-tight basket, and he asked her: “Say, skᴀñ,<a class="noteRef" id="n136.80src" href="#n136.80">81</a> have you seen my cousin?” She paid no attention to him, and he again said to her:
“Say, skᴀñ, have you seen my cousin?” Again she paid no attention to him. “Skᴀñ, I
can knock out your labret.” “Don’t. Over yonder is a qꜝa′ła<a class="noteRef" id="n136.81src" href="#n136.81">82</a> point, beyond which is a spruce point, beyond which is a hemlock point, beyond which
is an alder point. At that point in front of the shell of a sqā′djix̣ū<a class="noteRef" id="n136.82src" href="#n136.82">83</a> on which he is drawing is your cousin.” Then he started over, and it was as she said.
“Say, cousin, is that you?” [he said], and he pulled him up straight, and they started
off together.
</p>
<p>After they had gone on they came to a town. They (the people) were glad to see them.
Then they began giving them food. When they gave them berries to eat they asked Eagle:
“Does the chief eat these?” And Raven said: “Say that I like them very much.” But
Eagle said: “The chief says he never eats them.” And they only gave them to him (Eagle).
And again they gave him good berries to eat, and he said: “Those, too, the chief does
not like.”<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n136.82asrc" href="#n136.82">83</a>
</p>
<p>When he was going on from there he came to a town in which the chief’s son, who was
the strongest man, had had his arm pulled out. A shaman came to try to cure him. The
chief’s son was the strongest man. In trying strength with people of all ages by locking
hands with them he could beat them. By and by, through the smoke hole came a small
pale hand, and [they heard its owner] say: “Gū′sg̣a gᴀ′msiwa” (Tsimshian words meaning
“Let us have a try”). And he put his fingers to it. It pulled off his arm. They did
not know what it was. And he (Raven) alone knew that one of Gū′g̣ał’s<a class="noteRef" id="n136.83src" href="#n136.83">84</a> sons had pulled his arm off. Then he flew to Gū′g̣ał’s town, went to an old man who
lived at the end of the town and asked him: “Say, old man, do you ever gamble?” And
he said he did. “They say they pulled off the arm of a chief’s son. I wonder where
the person who did it belongs.” And he said: “Why, don’t you know? It was done by
the one of Gū′g̣ał’s sons who is always doing those things. The chief’s son’s arm
is in a box behind the screen in his father’s house.” And he (Raven) said: “Well,
although everybody knows those things, I was asking this.” Then he pulled off his
(the old man’s) skin and entered it. And next day he took a gambling-stick bag and
walked with a cane to the middle of the town. When he sat down he heard Gū′g̣ał’s
sons say: “You are always on hand, old man; we will gamble with you.” The eldest wagered
him his hair ribbon, and they gambled with him. They lost the ribbon to him. Then
it was too late to go home, and he <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>said: “I will stay right in your house.” And they said to him: “All right, old man,
sleep in our house so that we may gamble with each other in the morning.” Then he
entered, and they seated him near two good-looking women. They gave him something
to eat. “Old man, you are always ready,” they said to him, and they went to bed. Then
he broke wind. The women laughed at him every time as they whispered together. By
and by, when they were asleep,<a class="noteRef" id="n137.84src" href="#n137.84">85</a> he flew lightly toward the screen and felt of the chief’s son’s arm which was in
a box. Then he waited for daylight and flew over it. As he did so the ends of his
claws touched the top of the screen. It sounded like a drum. Then he lay down quickly.
“Alas! it is the one who is always doing such things. Does the old man lie there as
before?” And the women said: “Yes; he lies here. He has been breaking wind all the
time. Now, he is snoring.” And he asked again: “Is the chief’s son’s arm in the box?”
And the women said: “Yes; it is here.” Then when they were asleep again and day had
begun to break he flew up easily behind the screen and seized the chief’s son’s arm
in his mouth. And when he flew away with it the ends of his claws touched the top
of the screen. When it gave forth a drumming sound all looked up. He flew through
the smoke hole. The chief said: “Alas! it is he who is always doing such things.”
Then he came flying to the chief’s son’s father’s town and began to act as shaman
around the chief’s son. He washed the arm, which had begun to smell badly [from decomposition].
Then they handed him a new mat [and he laid] the chief’s son’s arm in place under
it. At once his arm was restored. They gave many things to him and much food as well.
</p>
<p>He started from that place also. After he had gone along for a while he came to a
town. The town people were glad to see him, and he went into a house. A good looking
woman lived in the house. Then they went to bed, and he went over to the woman. When
he came to her she asked him, “Who are you?” “I am one who came to this place for
you.” But the woman absolutely repulsed him. Then he went away from her. And when
the woman slept he went to her again and put dung inside of her blanket. Then he cried:
“I went to the chief’s daughter, but, finding something terrible there, changed my
mind.” And the woman awoke and said: “A′-a-a a-a′, don’t tell anybody about it. I
will give you a substance that my father owns but always keeps secret.” And he said:
“[Give me] some.” Then she gave all to him. And the woman said to him: “Don’t lose
it. With that you will have good luck. And when you see anyone, you can adorn him
with it,” she said to him. This is what causes people to be good-looking.
</p>
<p>After that his sister Siwa′s planted Indian tobacco in front of White inlet. And,
while it was yet in the garden, he calcined shells. But before he pulled the tobacco
out he became angry with the calcined <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>shells and threw them away. Where the calcined shells were the surface of the rocks
is white.
</p>
<p>There he went out fishing for his sister. He threw the halibut ashore. There is high,
level land there called “Halibut’s place.” He named places, too, as he went along.
“Your name will be like this; you will be called so-and-so,” he said as he went. Then
he passed over one place, and it called after him: “What shall my name be?” Then he
said to it in the Ninstints dialect: “Your name will be ‘Salt Stone,’ you common object.”
</p>
<p>Then he set out to spear Bad Weather (Tcꜝī′g̣a). He made a spear with a detachable
point. He used strong gut for cord. And he saw its head pass. Then he speared it.
And it tugged him about in a sitting posture. He kept hold of the cord and was pulled
out to a reef lying in front. After he had been pulled about there a while the spear
point broke. [The string] struck on the face of a declivity. There the rocks show
a white streak.
</p>
<p>When he went away he stuck an eagle’s tail feather [into a certain place]. That is
called “Eagle’s-tail-feather-stuck-in.”
</p>
<p>After that he was love-sick for his uncle’s wife. Then he sat there singing a song,
at the same time striking his head upon the rocks for a drum. There he made a hole.
That place is called “Moving-the-back-part-of-the-head-about-while-singing.”

<p>One time, when he was going along with his cousin, he came to an island of ʟꜝkꜝia′o.<a class="noteRef" id="n138.85src" href="#n138.85">86</a> At once he went out and ate them. After he got through eating, he went back toward
shore with his cousin. And when they became thirsty he said to his cousin: “Take one
stroke in the water, cousin.” As soon as he did so they came to Standing-water creek,
which was very far away. Where he drank there, there is a water hole of the shape
of his bill.
</p>
<p>This is why, when people travel by canoe on the west coast, the country is easy for
them (i.e., they travel about easily). The place where he and his cousin ate ʟꜝkꜝia′o

<p class="center">[Told to Prof. Franz Boas by Charlie Edenshaw, chief of the Stᴀ′stas]
</p>
<p>Nenk·îlsʟasʟiñgai’s<a class="noteRef" id="n138.87src" href="#n138.87">88</a> mother was Gēʟîk·ᴇdzā′t (“<span class="corr" id="xd32e22584" title="Source: Flood-tide woman">Flood-tide-woman</span>”). His father was ʟg̣ang̣ag·îñ (“Dorsal-fin”),<a class="noteRef" id="n138.88src" href="#n138.88">89</a> whose sister’s son was called ʟg̣anxē′la (“Hole-in-dorsal fin”). He was born in <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>Naēku′n. Now, Nenk·îlsʟasʟiñgai was crying all the time. The people tried to quiet
him, and they gave him various things to play with, but he was not satisfied. There
was a young girl, Qalgaitsadas (“Ice-woman”).<a class="noteRef" id="n139.89src" href="#n139.89">90</a> She also tried to quiet him. She took him in her arms, and he at once ceased crying.
He touched her breasts and was quiet. After a little while she returned him to his
mother. At once he began to cry again, but when she took him again he quieted down
when he touched her breast.
</p>
<p>The boy was growing up very rapidly. Now he was able to walk. ʟg̣anxē′la was his mother’s
lover. When his father, ʟg̣ang̣ag·îñ, found this out he became jealous, and he sent
his wife back to her uncle, Nenk·îlsʟas. Then she took her boy on her back and went
to her uncle’s house. About noon she felt hungry. She was going to start a fire, but
she did not succeed. She turned the fire drill until her hands were sore, but she
did not succeed in making a fire. Then Nenk·îlsʟasʟiñgai went into the woods, where
he took two large sticks. He struck the ends together, and at once there was a great
fire. His mother was surprised to see it, but she did not make any remark.
</p>
<p>In the evening they lay down and slept. Early the next morning they proceeded on their
journey. In the evening the mother tried again to start a fire, but she did not succeed.
Then the boy went to the woods and started the fire in the same manner as on the preceding
day.
</p>
<p>Finally they reached the house of Nenk·îlsʟas, which was located in ʟg̣aē′xa.<a class="noteRef" id="n139.90src" href="#n139.90">91</a> A large pole was standing in front of his house. Nenk·îlsʟas’s slaves were outside
the house when Gēʟîk·ᴇdzā′t was approaching, carrying her child. They entered the
house and told Nenk·îlsʟas that she was approaching. He remarked: “She is always acting
foolishly, therefore she has been sent back.” He told his slaves to call her into
the house. She entered and remained sitting near the doorway. She did not go to the
rear of the house. Her uncle gave her food. The boy was defecating in the house all
the time. His excrements were very thin and spread over the floor, so that the house
smelled very badly.
</p>
<p>The boy was staying with his mother. In the night, when everybody was asleep, he arose
from the side of his mother, left the house, taking bow and arrows, and shot woodpeckers
(sʟō′ts’ada). He gave them to his mother and asked her to make a blanket of their
skins. His mother dried these skins and sewed them up. Then he began to shoot whales,
which he took to a little river near ʟgaē′xa, named Xagusiua′s.<a class="noteRef" id="n139.91src" href="#n139.91">92</a> Then Raven came right down from the sky, intending to eat the whales. The boy tried
to shoot it, but he was unable to kill it. Raven flew away, but soon returned. Again
the boy tried to shoot it, but did not hit it. Finally, however, he succeeded in killing
Raven. He hid its skin between the branches of a large tree.
</p>
<p>One day the boy said to his uncle: “My fathers are going to come <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>from Naēku′n to look for my mother.” Then his uncle remarked: “I am afraid that boy
is going to cause us trouble. Stop your talking.” But Nenk·îlsʟasʟiñgai repeated his
former statement. The following day he said again: “My fathers are going to come from
Naēku′n to see me.” Again his uncle begged him to be silent, but he did not obey.
</p>
<p>After a few days the people from Naēku′n arrived. The beach was covered with canoes.
Then his uncle felt greatly troubled. He had many slaves. The boy said to one of the
slaves: “Go out and tell them to come ashore.” His fathers were the Killer-whales.
Then they came ashore and fell down. His father and his cousin ʟganxē′la were among
those whales. Then his mother took a bailer and sprinkled some water over ʟganxē′la,
while she left her husband to perish. After some time the boy said to a slave: “Go
out and call the water to cover my fathers.” Then the tide returned, and the whales
returned to Naēku′n. The boy continued to shoot birds.
</p>
<p>His uncle’s wife was making mats all the time. The boy was very beautiful, but he
continued to defecate in the house. His uncle’s wife was sitting in the rear of the
house. The boy had collected much red gum, which he was chewing. One day he returned
home just at the time when his uncle had finished his dinner and was washing his face.
Then his uncle’s wife asked him for some gum which was hanging out of the boy’s mouth.
The boy fell in love with his uncle’s wife, who was sitting on the highest platform
of the house. The boy crept silently up to the woman and encircled her, placing his
head under her left arm, his body over her back, and his feet under her right arm.
When the woman looked down she saw that he was very pretty. His uncle did not notice
it. He (the uncle) was a great hunter, and he always brought back a great quantity
of food. Every evening, when his uncle had gone out hunting, he visited the woman.
[The boy was staying in the house all the time; his soul went out hunting birds and
visiting the woman.] As soon as he reached the woman it thundered, and he was much
frightened. He defecated, and the house was so full of excrements that the slaves
had to carry them out in buckets. When his uncle Nenk·îlsʟasʟiñgai came home he was
about to give the game to his wife. He asked her why it had thundered that day. “It
is a sign that my nephew cohabits with you [he said].”
</p>
<p>In the village T’ano<a class="noteRef" id="n140.92src" href="#n140.92">93</a> there was a chief whose name was Qîng·. The boy said: “I want Qîng· to come here
to be my father.” His uncle, who was sitting in the rear of the house, heard what
he was saying. He asked his sister to command the boy to be silent, but he continued
to say it. One day many canoes arrived on the beach. Then the boy said to his uncle:
“The chiefs are coming. What are you going to do?” His uncle did not reply because
he was afraid. When they approached the house the boy threw off his skin, and he was
beautiful. <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>The chief who arrived here was called Qoēqqu′ns.<a class="noteRef" id="n141.93src" href="#n141.93">94</a> He lived in the middle of the ocean. He was his mother’s father. The boy had visited
him and had borrowed his people, whom he took to his uncle’s house. He had put on
his woodpecker blanket, and he flew to his grandfather’s house. He painted his face
with a design of Ts’agul<a class="noteRef" id="n141.94src" href="#n141.94">95</a> and made himself very beautiful. When he returned he walked about inside the house
scolding his uncle: “Why is there nobody staying with you? Now, all the chiefs are
coming, and there is nobody to receive them.” Then Nenk·îlsʟasʟiñgai stamped his feet,
and immediately the house was full of people. He had transformed the dirt on the floor
of the house into people by stamping once. In one corner of his house were Qoēqqu′ns’s
people, who spoke the Tsimshian language. When he stamped with his foot in another
corner of the house people appeared who spoke Heiltsuk (or Wakashan). In the next
corner, when he stamped the ground, the Haida arose, and in the last corner he also
created Haida.
</p>
<p>After a while Qîng· arrived. They performed a dance, and Nenk·îlsʟasʟiñgai gave them
to eat. Then Qîng· returned to his own country. The boy accompanied him. When he made
the Tsimshian he wore a flicker<a class="noteRef" id="n141.95src" href="#n141.95">96</a> (Sqaldzit) blanket. Then he changed and wore a woodpecker (<span lang="hax">sʟodz’adang</span>) blanket. Afterward he used a Six­asʟdᴀlgang<a class="noteRef" id="n141.96src" href="#n141.96">97</a> blanket. This is a large bird with yellow head, which flies very rapidly. Finally
he used a T’in<a class="noteRef" id="n141.97src" href="#n141.97">98</a> blanket. This is a bird that is eaten in Victoria. When they arrived in Qîng·’s house
Nenk·îlsʟasʟiñgai sat between Qîng· and his wife. The chief asked him: “Are you hungry?”
But he did not want to eat. He was chewing gum all the time. In the house there were
many people. Two youths were standing on one side of the door when the chief was eating.
The chief sent some food to them. Their skin was quite black. Their name was Squl
(“Porpoise”). They were eating ravenously. The boy asked: “How is it that you can
eat so much?” They replied: “Don’t ask us. We are very poor because we are hungry
all the time.” But he insisted. He said: “I can not eat, and I must learn how to eat.
You must assist me to learn.” They refused, but Nenk·îlsʟasʟiñgai insisted. They said:
“We are afraid of your father. If we tell you, you will have bad luck.” But the boy
would not accept their statements. Then they became angry and said: “Go and bathe,
and when you do so scratch your skin and eat what you scratch off. Do so twice.” The
youth did so, and then he became very hungry. He told his father: “I am a little hungry.”
Then the old man was very glad. He called all the people to see how his child was
eating. The people came, and when they had seen it they returned. After a very short
time the youth was hungry again. His father invited the people, and after they had
eaten they went away. <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>It was not long before the boy was hungry again. He could not get enough to eat. He
ate all the provisions that were stored in the house. Then Qîng· turned the boy out
of his house and he was very poor. He asked to be admitted again, but Qîng· did not
allow him to enter. Then he took his raven skin and put it on. He knocked the walls
of the house with his beak, asking admission, but he was refused.
</p>
<p>He promised to give them fox, mountain goat, and other kinds of animals. Then he went
down to the beach, where he ate some excrements. After a while he returned to the
house and asked again for admission. Then the boy grew angry, and wished the waters
to rise. The waters began to rise, and rose up to Qîng·’s throat. Then Qîng·’s sister
and her ten children began to climb up his hat, which was transformed into a mountain,
which may still be seen near the village. There is another mountain near by which
is called <span lang="hax">Qîñg·i xa′ñginᴇñ gutas’wa′s</span>.
</p>
<p>Then the boy returned to his uncle, and the people returned to their villages. The
boy was in love with his uncle’s wife, and his uncle was jealous. Then he called upon
the waters to rise, intending to kill his nephew. The waters were coming out of Nenk·îlsʟas’s
hat. Then the boy took the skin of a waterfowl (<span lang="hax">Q’ē′sq’ut</span>),<a class="noteRef" id="n142.98src" href="#n142.98">99</a> which he put on. The house began to fill with water. Then he swam about on the water.
He was carrying the raven skin under his arm. When the water rose still higher, he
flew up through the smoke hole and reached the sky. He shot an arrow up to the sky,
which stuck in it. Then he continued to shoot, hitting the nock of the first arrow;
and thus he proceeded, making a chain which reached almost down into the waters. Finally
he fastened his bow to the lowest arrow and climbed upward. When he reached the sky,
he broke it, went through, and saw five countries above. First he came to an open
place in which many berries were growing. There were salmon in the rivers, and the
people were singing. He was chewing gum. He tried to find the singers, but he could
not discover them. He passed the place whence the noise proceeded, and turned back
again. Finally, after a long time, he found them. He saw a number of women who were
singing. He asked them, “Where did you obtain this song? I like it very much.” Then
they laughed at him, and said, “Did you never hear that there are five countries up
here, and that the inhabitants use this song? They are singing about Nenk·îlsʟasʟîñgai′,
who is in love with his uncle’s wife.” At that time he received the name Nenk·îlsʟasʟîñgai′.
He wandered about in heaven for many years, singing all the time.
</p>
<p>He came to a large river, where he heard the people singing. He came to a town near
which he saw a pond. The chief’s daughter went out to fetch water. Then Nenk·îlsʟasʟîñgai′
transformed himself into the leaf of a hemlock, and dropped into the bucket of water
which <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>the chief’s daughter dipped from the pond. When she attempted to drink, the hemlock
leaf was in her way, and she tried to blow it away, but did not succeed. Finally she
grew impatient and swallowed it with the water. After two months she had a child,
and her father was very glad. The child slept at his mother’s side, but at midnight,
when all were asleep, he traveled all over the country and came to a town. The people
were all asleep, and during the night he ate their eyes. When the people awoke in
the morning, they found that they were blind. They asked one another, “Did not you
hear a story about such a thing happening?” But the old people said they never had
heard of such a thing. The next night he proceeded to another town, where he also
ate the eyes of all the people. Then he did the same in a third town. The people did
not know how they lost their eyesight. Finally he went to a fourth town and ate the
eyes of the people.
</p>
<p>There was an old man in the corner of the chief’s house. He did not sleep because
he wished to discover how the people in the various towns were blinded. One night
he saw the boy arise from the side of his mother and return early in the morning.
He returned with his skin blanket filled with something. The old man saw him sitting
down near his mother’s fire and taking out something round from his blanket. While
doing so he was laughing. Then the old man knew that he had taken the eyes of the
people.
</p>
<p>When, the next morning, the people heard that the inhabitants of another town had
lost their eyes the old man said that he had seen how the young man ate the eyes while
his mother was asleep, that he had carried them back to the house in his blanket,
and that he had eaten them sitting near the fire.
</p>
<p>The floor of the house was made of stone. The chief then broke it, took the boy, and
threw him down to our earth. At that time the water was still high, and only the top
of his totem pole was seen above the surface of the water. The boy dropped upon the
top of the totem pole, crying “Qa!” and assumed the shape of a raven. The pole split
in two when he dropped down upon it. Then the waters began to subside, and he began
his migrations.
</p>
<p>He went to a rock from which the wind was blowing all the time. He intended to kill
the [s. e.] wind, <span lang="hax">Xēiō′</span>. He tried to make canoes from various kinds of wood, but they did not satisfy him.
Then he asked the birds to carry him there, but they could not do it. Finally he took
the maple tree, and he succeeded in making a good canoe. He vanquished the wind and
made him his slave.
</p>
<p>Xāusgana<a class="noteRef" id="n143.99src" href="#n143.99">100</a> was fishing for halibut. The Raven went to visit him. He was kindly received, because
Xāusgana did not know that he was trying to steal food wherever he went. One morning
when he went out fishing Raven said: “On my travels I saw a large island on <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>which there are a great many woodpeckers.” Xāusgana believed him. He said: “Let us
go and see it.” One day, when the water was calm, they started, accompanied by Xāusgana’s
wife. They paddled toward the island, and Raven said: “Stay here in the canoe while
I go ashore to hunt woodpeckers in the woods.” There were many <span lang="hax">sʟāskʼᴇma</span> (a plant bearing something resembling berries) in the woods. Raven took one of these
and struck his nose until it bled. Then he transformed the blood into woodpeckers.
Then he went back to the canoe and said: “Did you see the woodpeckers coming out of
the woods?” By this time many woodpeckers had come out from under the trees, and Xāusgana
became eager to hunt them. Fishermen are in the habit of tying the red feathers of
the woodpeckers to their hooks in order to secure good luck.<a class="noteRef" id="n144.100src" href="#n144.100">101</a>
</p>
<p>As soon as Xāusgana had gone a hunting Raven went back to the canoe. He lay down in
it and thought: “I wish that a wind would start from the island and that the canoe
would drift away!” He pulled his blanket over his head and pretended to sleep. Now
a wind arose, and the canoe drifted away. When Xāusgana saw this he shouted: “Wake
up! You are drifting out to sea!” but Raven did not stir. Then Xāusgana was greatly
troubled because he had lost his canoe. As soon as Raven was out of sight he assumed
the shape of Xāusgana and turned the canoe toward his house. He went up to the house
and said to Xāusgana’s wife:<a class="noteRef" id="n144.101src" href="#n144.101">102</a> “That man who came visiting us is Raven. He is a liar.” Then the woman gave him to
eat, and after he had finished the food he asked for more. The woman remarked: “How
does it happen that you are so hungry now? Formerly you never ate as much as you do
to-day.” She was unable to satisfy his hunger. At night he lay down with her. He lived
in the house, and people believed that he was Xāusgana.
</p>
<p>The latter was staying on the island, unable to leave it. After a while he thought:
“I wish my rattle would come here!” The rattle obeyed his summons. Then he wished
his bow to come. Then he walked home over the surface of the water as though it were
firm land. He reached his village. After a while he saw his wife coming out of the
house. He called her and told her: “The Raven has cheated you. Let us take revenge.
Close all the chinks of our house and lock the door. When everything is done shut
the smoke hole; then I will appear and take revenge.” The woman reentered the house
and acted as though nothing had happened. She prepared food for him, and he ate. While
he was eating he said all the time: “It is strange how much I have changed. Formerly
I was never as hungry as I am now.”
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the woman closed all the chinks of the house. Then Xāusgana entered. Raven
put on his skin and tried to escape, but Xāusgana caught him and killed him. He broke
his bones to pieces <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>and threw him into the latrine. On the following day when his wife went to defecate
Raven spit upward at her genitalia. He took the body and struck it again, and he took
a large stone and pounded it to jelly. Then he threw it into the sea. It drifted about
on the water. One day many people went out in their canoe. When they saw the body
they remarked: “Why is that chief drifting about on the water?” And the body replied,
“A woman is the cause of this.”
</p>
<p>After a while he thought, “I wish that a whale would come and swallow me!” Then the
whale came and swallowed him.
</p>
<p>Here follows the story of the Raven in the Whale.
</p>
<p>The whale stranded and was discovered by the people. They came and cut it. Then Raven
thought: “I wish that the chief’s son would open the whale’s stomach, that I may get
out again!” At once the chief’s son cut open the whale’s stomach. Then Raven flew
out right against the young man’s chest. The youth fell down dead. Then the people
were afraid, and ran away.
</p>
<p>Raven flew into the woods, and assumed the shape of an old man. He came back, leaning
on a staff, and asked the people: “Why are you running away?” They told him what had
happened. Then he said, “I heard that the same events happened long ago. At that time
the people left the town, leaving all their property behind. I think it would be best
for you to do the same.” Then the people, who were much afraid, left the village at
once. Raven stayed behind, and ate all their provisions.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Beaver<a class="noteRef" id="n145.102src" href="#n145.102">103</a> was a chief who had his room in the rear of a very beautiful house. Behind the house
there was a large lake, where Beaver went to play. Then he returned to his house.
In the lake there were many salmon, and on the shores were growing all kinds of berries.
When he returned home he carried a fish, which he boiled.
</p>
<p>One day Raven, who desired to rob Beaver of his treasures, disguised himself as a
poor, ugly person. In this shape he went to Beaver’s house. In the evening Beaver
came home, bringing a fish and berries, which he intended to boil. Raven arranged
it so that he should meet him. Then Beaver asked: “What are you doing here?” Raven
replied: “My father has just died. He said that you are my brother. We have the same
ancestors. He told me to go to visit you and to ask you for food.” Then Beaver invited
him to his house. He boiled his fish, and when it was cooked he let Raven partake
of the meal. He believed him and pitied him.
</p>
<p>Next day Beaver went to the lake. He told Raven to stay at home. Toward noon he returned,
carrying a salmon, and he spoke kindly to Raven, promising to feed him all the time.
He told him that there were always fish in the lake and ripe berries on its shores.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the following day Raven went out to the lake. He rolled up the water like a blanket,
took a number of fish out, boiled them, and ate them. When Beaver came home he found
Raven crying and pretending to be hungry. On the following day Raven went out again.
He rolled up the water, took it in his beak, and flew away. He alighted on the top
of a large cedar tree.
</p>
<p>When Beaver went out in order to fish in his lake he found that it was gone, and he
saw Raven sitting on a tree, holding the water. Then Beaver called the monster Tā′ʟat’adᴇga,<a class="noteRef" id="n146.103src" href="#n146.103">104</a> which has a long body, a long tail, and many legs; and he called all the beavers
and the bears and asked them to throw the tree down. The wolves dug up its roots,
the beavers gnawed the trunk of the tree, and all the animals tried to do what was
in their power. Finally the tree fell. Then Raven flew off to another tree. They tried
to throw this tree down. All the animals of the forest helped Beaver. After they had
thrown down four trees they asked a favor of Raven: “Please give us our chief’s water.
Don’t make us unhappy!” But he did not comply with their request. He flew away, and
spit some of the water on the ground as he flew along. Thus originated all the rivers
on Queen Charlotte islands. He also made the Skeena and Stikine rivers.
</p>
<p>There was a man named K·ʼî′lkun, who lived at Skidegate. He asked Raven to give him
some water. Raven complied with his request, but gave him very little only. This annoyed
him so much that he fell down dead. He forms the long point of land near Skidegate.<a class="noteRef" id="n146.104src" href="#n146.104">105</a> The same thing happened at Naēku′n.<a class="noteRef" id="n146.105src" href="#n146.105">106</a> For this reason there is a long point of land at that place.
</p>
<p class="small">This is the best known, as it is the longest, of all stories told on the upper northwest
coast, and many writers have given fragments of it. Although often spoken of as the
creation legend, it would be more correct to say that it explains how things were
altered from one state or condition into that in which we now find them. Thus topographic
features, natural phenomena, the tastes, passions, habits, and customs of animals
and human beings are mainly explained by referring to something that Raven did in
ancient times. He was not the only originator of all these things, but he was the
principal, and for that reason he was known as <span lang="hax">Nᴀñkî′lsʟas</span> (“He-whose-voice-is-obeyed”). Until <span lang="hax">Qî′ñgî</span> adopted him he was called <span lang="hax">Nᴀñkî′lsʟas-łîña′-i</span> (“The-potential-Nᴀñkî′lsʟas”). Some even said that <span lang="hax">Nᴀñkî′lsʟas</span> was a great chief who put on the skin of a raven only when he wanted to act like
a buffoon. Among the three peoples who have developed this story most—Haida, Tlingit,
and Tsimshian—the Raven clan is also of very great importance, and it is evident to
me that there is a causal relation between the two facts. I have, however, discussed
the singular prominence of the Raven clan among the people in this region in volume
<span class="asc">V</span>, part 1, of the Memoirs of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition, page 104.
</p>
<p class="small">Aware of the important position held by this myth, I made a special endeavor to secure
as much of it as possible and consulted several different story-tellers. The main
portion of the story was given me by John Sky, a Kloo man, who also related the five
next and that on page 86. A long section was added by Walter McGregor, who belonged
to the people of the west-coast town of Kaisun, and fragments were contributed by
Abraham, an old man of Kloo, by Tom Stevens, chief of Those-born-at-House-point, the
ancient people of Rose spit, and by Job Moody, a man of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>Witch people of Cumshewa and father of my interpreter. A second version is appended.
This was obtained in English by Prof. Franz Boas from Charlie Edenshaw, chief of the
great Masset family Stᴀ′stas. He spent his earlier years at Skidegate, so I am not
certain whether it is more like the story as told at Skidegate or as told at Masset.
I am inclined to think, however, that it approaches the form in which it was told
by the people of Rose spit. While at Masset I secured several additional texts bearing
on events in the life of Raven, some of them differing considerably from the above.
An abstract of these texts will be found on pages 207–211 of volume <span class="asc">V</span>, part 1, of the Memoirs of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition. On pages 233–238 of
the same memoir will be found two sections of the story obtained from two old Kaigani.
They probably contain much of the Tlingit Raven story. Finally, it must be stated
that Raven is brought forward to explain so many local phenomena that an absolutely
complete Raven story is neither practicable nor necessary.

<p class="first center">[Told by John Sky of Those-born-at-Skedans]
</p>
<p>Once there was a chief’s child, they say, a girl, for whom they often hung out hawk
down on the end of a pole.<a class="noteRef" id="n151.1src" href="#n151.1">1</a> Her father loved her. She had two brothers; one was large and the other had just
begun growing.
</p>
<p>Once people came in front of her father’s town in ten canoes, danced while coming
and stopped in front of the town. Then one of her father’s slaves inquired: “What
are these come for?” “They are come to get the chief’s child.” And when they said
“The woman refuses,” they went away weeping.
</p>
<p>The next day others came dancing on ten canoes. Then again they asked: “What are these
come for?” “They are come to get the chief’s daughter.” And those, too, they refused,
and they went weeping away.
</p>
<p>Now, the day after a certain one in a hair-seal canoe,<a class="noteRef" id="n151.2src" href="#n151.2">2</a> wearing a broad hat, stood there early in the morning. He had a surf-bird for a hat.
After they had looked at him in his hair-seal canoe for a while, they asked him: “Why
does the canoe come?” He said nothing. They did not want him. They said to him: “The
woman refuses.” A round white thing was on top of his hat. This was a foamy wave.
The foam was turning round and round rapidly. As soon as they had refused him the
earth changed. Out of the earth water boiled up. Then, when this island was half covered,
the frightened town people thought of giving the woman up. She had ten servants, they
say. And they dressed up one of these just like her. And they painted her. And they
put red cirrus clouds on her and two clear-sky blankets<a class="noteRef" id="n151.3src" href="#n151.3">3</a> and sent her down to the chief. Then he absolutely refused her. He would take none
but the chief’s child. They dressed up still another [slave] with dark mottled clouds
which lie seaward, and they put two marten-skin blankets on her and had her go down.
Her, too, he refused. He refused all ten in the same way.
</p>
<p>Now, all of the town people with their children had gone into her father’s house.
Then they all cried, and, without painting her, let her go. And the ten servants all
went with her. When she stood near the salt water the canoe came quickly to her of
itself. [Then the stranger gave them his father’s hat covered with surf-birds (<span lang="hax">tcꜝîgᴀ′ldᴀx̣uañ</span>), which would keep flying out from it and back again.] Now, when she got in, the
ten servants got in with her. What caused the canoe to move could not be seen. When
the chief’s child had got in they discovered him floating at the place where he had
been before.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>And they made holes in the front of the whole house by pulling off planks. Through
these they were looking to see which way his canoe went. After they had looked for
a while [it vanished and] they did not see in which direction. And they did not see
that it had sunk. And the direction in which the chief’s daughter had vanished was
unknown.
</p>
<p>At times her father turned to the wall and cried, cried, cried. And her mother turned
to the wall and cried, cried, cried. One day he stopped crying and said to his head
slave:<a class="noteRef" id="n152.4src" href="#n152.4">4</a> “Find out whither my child went.” “Wait, I will find out the proper time to go. I
will go to see whither your [child] went.”
</p>
<p>One morning, as day began to break and when it was a propitious day for him, he started
the fire, and, while the people of the house whom he feared to have see him, slept,
he took a bath. Now after his skin became dry he turned toward the wall and brought
out the tackle he used for fishing. He untied it, and he took out blue hellebore,
and he put it into the fire. And after he had watched it burn a while, he took it
out of the fire, and he rubbed it on the stone floor-planks and made a mark with it
on his face.
</p>
<p>Then he got ready to start. He was going to search for the chief’s child. The chief’s
child’s mother was with him.
</p>
<p>And he was a good hunter. He had a sea-otter spear. When he pushed off he threw the
sea-otter spear into the water, and, throwing its tail about, it went along forming
ripples in its passage, and he went with it.
</p>
<p>By and by the canoe stuck. The same thing happened to the sea-otter spear, they say.
Then he pulled the canoe ashore. The chief’s wife got off, and he turned the canoe
over. Long seaweeds were growing on it. These were the things that stopped the canoe.
He had been moving along for a whole year. Then he took off his cape and rubbed it
on the bottom of the canoe and on the chief’s wife. And he rubbed it on himself as
well and became clean.
</p>
<p>Again he shoved off the canoe. Then he threw the sea-otter spear into the water again,
and it moved on anew. He followed it. After he had gone on, on, on, on for a long
while, the canoe again stuck. Then he pulled the canoe ashore still again. And he
turned it over again. [A kind of] long seaweed had grown on it, and on the chief’s
wife, too, and on himself. Then, as before, he took the cape off. And he rubbed it
on the canoe and on the chief’s wife as well. Then he rubbed it also on himself. And
after they had become clean he launched the canoe again. Again he threw the sea-otter
spear in, and again they followed it. After he had been towed along by it for a while
he came to floating charcoal. There was no way for him to pass through this, they
say. He had brought along his fishing-tackle box, and he looked into it. And in it
he used to keep the [old <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>spruce roots] taken off when he repaired his halibut hooks. When he put these roots
into the water, [the charcoal] divided, and he was towed through. Not far away the
canoe came to another place where it (the passage) had closed together. And when he
put some [roots] into the water, as before, that also parted.
</p>
<p>Then he was towed out of it and was brought to the edge of the sky. Now, after it
had shut together four times, he braced the spear under it.<a class="noteRef" id="n153.5src" href="#n153.5">5</a> He went under. Then he pulled his spear out and put it into the canoe. He took the
paddle and began paddling.
</p>
<p>By and by he could see the smoke of a great town. And he pulled the canoe ashore some
distance to one side of the town, they say. After he had turned the canoe over he
made the chief’s wife sit under it. Then he walked to the town. When he came to the
end of the town it was low tide. A certain woman, with her infant on her back, had
come down to the uncovered beach. She held a basket in her hand, and she had a digging
stick and moved it before her as if hunting for something. While putting something
into the basket she looked up to where he was seated. And, after she had looked for
a while, she did the same thing again. And, after she had rolled away the stones,
she put sea cucumbers into the basket. That was Property-woman.<a class="noteRef" id="n153.6src" href="#n153.6">6</a>
</p>
<p>When she again fastened her eyes on the place where he sat, she said: “I know you.”
And then he stood up. And he went down on the beach and stood near her. Then she said
to him: “Do you travel hither expecting to see the chief’s child?” He said “Yes.”
“You see this town. He thought grease into his son’s wife’s mind<a class="noteRef" id="n153.7src" href="#n153.7">7</a> because he gave away his father’s hat as soon as he married the chief’s child.<a class="noteRef" id="n153.8src" href="#n153.8">8</a> She is lying over there in a cave. When you have entered pass along by the right
side of the chief’s house and go behind the screen. There you will hear news.”
</p>
<p>Then he started away from Property-woman and went into the cave to the chief’s child.
And as she lay there she was winking her eyes. He took his coat off and rubbed it
upon her. And he tried to make her sit up. In vain. And he became angry because he
was unsuccessful. And, since he could not succeed, he started off.
</p>
<p>He put on his two yellow-cedar blankets and walked about among them (the people).
And they did not see him. Then he went into the chief’s house and to the right. It
had ten tiers of retaining planks. On the upper one, in the middle of the sides, one
sat weaving a chief’s dancing-blanket. Then from the blanket she was weaving something
said: “To-morrow, too, one of my eyes [will still be] unfinished, unfinished.”<a class="noteRef" id="n153.9src" href="#n153.9">9</a>
</p>
<p>Then, contrary to the expectations of those in the house, he went round behind the
screen and a wonderful sight met his eyes, they say. A large lake with several gravel
points running into it lay there. <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>The points were red with cranberries. Canoe songs<a class="noteRef" id="n154.10src" href="#n154.10">10</a> resounded across it. Near the stream which flowed out of this large lake they had
a fire for [drinking] salt water.<a class="noteRef" id="n154.11src" href="#n154.11">11</a>
</p>
<p>Then some people came in from picking berries. As she walked past the last one snuffed
with her nose. “I smell a human being” [she said]. And he said to her, “Say! it is
I you are speaking about.” “It was the yellow cedar-bark blankets of the chief’s child’s
ten servants whom they ate, which I am wearing that I smelt.” That was Mink-woman.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n154.11asrc" href="#n154.11">11</a>
</p>
<p>And now he turned himself toward the fire which they had made [to warm] salt water.
When he got near, one among those sitting there in a group said: “What will happen
when they (her family) look for the chief’s daughter?” “Why, what are you saying?
When they look for the chief’s child and return his father’s hat which he (the son)
gave away, he (the father) will make her sit down (i.e., restore her).”
</p>
<p>After he had heard all the news he turned round. He remembered the chief’s wife, ran
back to the canoe and turned it over, but only the chief’s wife’s bones lay there.
Then he drew his coat off and rubbed it upon her, and she awoke as if from sleep.
She had been perspiring. He put his arm into the canoe and pulled it into the water.
After he had let the chief’s wife in he came to the village. He tied her into the
canoe. He tied himself in the same way as the chief’s wife. He tied himself as Property-woman
had told him to do. They were there tied in front of the chief’s house. As they floated
there one came out of the chief’s house and said: “Wait; they want the chief’s wife
to remain there. They are going to dance near by.” After she had remained there for
a while a thunderbolt [appeared to] drop in the house, they say.
</p>
<p>By and by feathers came out of the smoke hole in a point. After it rose into the air
it broke off. Then it came to them in a point and struck them, and they both forgot
themselves.
</p>
<p>They came to themselves lying on the retaining timbers. And then he untied himself
and the chief’s wife as well. When he could walk he untied her. Her son-in-law sat
opposite the door, and they spread out mats for her below. Then they came down and
sat in the middle of the side.<a class="noteRef" id="n154.12src" href="#n154.12">12</a> Then one brought food in a small basket. In it were large clam shells, small clam
shells, and two mussel shells. They gave some to the chief’s wife. They let her eat.
After different kinds of food had been brought out and eaten and all was gone, they
brought a basket to the fire, poured water into it, and put stones into the fire.
When these were red-hot they put them into the basket with wooden tongs.
</p>
<p>It boiled. Then the chief said something to a youth who was walking around the basket.
Then he went into a storeroom in one corner <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>and brought out a whale on the end of a sharpened stick. He put it into the basket.
Now, when he had tried it with a stick and it had become soft, he put the whale into
a dish the shape of a chiton and laid it down before them.
</p>
<p>Now he again said something, and he (the youth) gave her old clam shells to drink
the soup out of. She was unable to drink with these. Now she got her own basket and
took out two large clam shells and two mussel shells, whereupon the people all stopped
in a moment as when something is dropped.<a class="noteRef" id="n155.13src" href="#n155.13">13</a> And the chief, too, looked at nothing but those mussel shells. When his eyes were
fastened upon them she noticed it and stopped.
</p>
<p>Then she handed the shells to her husband’s slave and had him give them to her son-in-law.
He made a place for them [on his blanket]. Now, after he had looked at them for a
while, he said something, whereupon they went to him to get them and put them away
behind the screen.
</p>
<p>In the evening those in the house went to sleep, and they (the visitors) also went
to sleep.
</p>
<p>When day broke a young hair seal was crying in the corner of the house, they say.
At daylight they started off by canoe.
</p>
<p>Now the canoe lay on top of the retaining planks. There he fastened the chief’s wife,
and he fastened himself in the stern. The thunderbolt dropped behind the screens which
pointed toward each other. When the feathers came out from it in a point toward the
fire and struck them they forgot themselves. When they came to themselves they were
on the ocean.
</p>
<p>Now he untied himself, went to the chief’s wife, and untied her. And when they went
off it was the middle of summer when the young hair seal cry. He picked up his paddle
and started paddling. After he had made two strokes he reached his master’s town.
</p>
<p>The chief’s wife went in and sat down. She related to her husband how his daughter
was situated. Then the slave also went to his master and told him what those thought
who had had a fire for salt water. He repeated what they said to him word for word.
</p>
<p>At once he spoke to the one who had charge of the fire. Two persons went through the
town summoning the people. Immediately they entered. The house was full. Then he opened
supplies of good food. He fed them. He fed them all. When the food was all gone he
told the town people what he had in mind. He told the town people that he was going
to look for his daughter. All were well pleased. He told all the chiefs to start in
ten canoes. They agreed.
</p>
<p>But the next morning his oldest boy had disappeared. When they began to get ready
the next day the youngest also was gone.
</p>
<p>For the chief and the chief’s wife each they drew the figures of cumulus clouds upon
ten clam shells. As many mussel shells were <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>inside of these. He had ten drawn for the elder [son] and he had ten drawn for the
younger. The town people who were going away all gathered ten apiece [for the men]
and five apiece for the women. And after they had got through gathering them they
waited for the two sons who had gone off to marry. They got tired of waiting for them
because they wanted to restore their sister. The town people had everything ready
and were awaiting them.
</p>
<p>The elder got home at midday. His hair was fastened with cedar limbs. “Mother, I have
brought a wife to you. She stands outside. Go out and get her.” So he spoke to his
mother: “Oh! my child has come.” She looked outside, and a woman stood there having
curly hair parted and large eyes. This was Mouse-woman.
</p>
<p>After the youngest had been away for a while, he, too, came back at midday. He came
in, his hair fastened with a small fern. Hai hi hi hi hi⁺⁺⁺.<a class="noteRef" id="n156.14src" href="#n156.14">14</a> “Mother, I bring a wife to you. She stands outside. Go out and get her.” A wonderful
person stood there. She was too powerful to look at. Something short with curly hair
and a copper blanket [stood there]. “Chief-woman, come in.” She did not wish to enter.
“She does not wish to come in. She positively refuses, my child; your wife positively
refuses.” “Why! she goes by contraries,” he said to her as he stood up. He went out
to his wife, came in with her, and sat down.
</p>
<p>Next day, very early, they went off. The town people all started out together upon
the ocean. The elder son’s wife sat up on one of the seats, and the younger one’s
wife concealed herself inside. She (the former) sat up high to look after those who
were starting off. She always kept her small wooden box with her wherever she turned.
When they were all afloat she hunted in it and took out a bone awl. And she put it
into the water. The water rushed aside as it cut through. In behind it they placed
the canoe. The bone awl began to tow them along.
</p>
<p>After they had been towed along, along, along, along, along for a while, they came
in sight of a broad band of smoke from a town. Some distance from the town the elder
brother’s wife told them all to land. She talked to them. The elder brother had married
Mouse-woman so that they might follow her directions.
</p>
<p>They stopped at this place, and she had them cut long sticks. They got two poles at
this place. The younger brother’s wife hid herself, but the elder brother’s wife commanded
the voyagers. The ten canoes were still, and along the front of the bows and midway
of the canoes they put the sticks. They fastened them to thwarts by winding ropes
around them.<a class="noteRef" id="n156.15src" href="#n156.15">15</a> That was finished. Then they started for the front of the town.
</p>
<p>They stopped in front of the chief’s house, and one came out of the chief’s house.
“Wait, they direct you to remain still. They are <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>going to dance in front of you.” After they had remained there for a while, they forgot
themselves. Then they came to themselves lying on top of the retaining planks. In
the place where they woke up they untied themselves. They also untied the poles that
had been fastened upon the canoes.
</p>
<p>On top of the retaining planks they spread out mats. There were crowds of people there
on each side on the ten retaining planks. The chief’s child was not there, the one
they came after. Only her husband sat there. Then they spread out two mats in front
of the place where he sat. In front of him the ten canoe loads of people laid their
clam shells. They filled the house up to the very roof. Now they laid the hat on top
of all. They gave it back to him.
</p>
<p>“Come! send for my father. Tell him to hurry.” Then a youth started on the run. “Is
he coming?” “He is close by.” Whiu-u-u-u (sound of wind). The house moved. The earth,
too, shook. Of all the visitors who sat in circles not one looked up. But, while they
hung their heads, the younger brother’s wife raised hers up. Then she looked toward
the rear of the house and toward the door. “Hold up your heads. Have you, also, no
power?” she said.
</p>
<p>By and by the house shook again, and the ground with it. X̣u-u-u. The people in the
house again hung their heads. Now she said again “Hold your heads up. Have you, too,
no supernatural power?” At the same time he came in and stood there. Something wonderful
came in and stood there. His large eyelids were too powerful to look at. Where he
placed his foot he stood for awhile. When he took another step the earth and the house
shook. When he took another step and the house and the earth shook, all of the people
hung their heads; but she (the youngest’s wife) said to them, “Hold your heads up.”
When she said it louder the supernatural power that had entered took hold of his head.
“Stop! mighty supernatural woman that you are.” After that he came in. Nothing happened.<a class="noteRef" id="n157.16src" href="#n157.16">16</a> He sat down near his son.
</p>
<p>But when he first came in and sat down he laid his hands at once on his hat.
</p>
<p>With his father’s staff he divided the clam shells. He kept the smaller part for himself.
He made his father’s part large. “Did you send for your wife, chief, my son?” “No,
indeed; I have been waiting for you.” “Send someone for your wife, chief, my son.”
Then a youth went to call her. “Is she coming?” “Yes; she approaches.” By and by the
one whom they were after came in from the cave where she had lain, and stood there.
But she went to her mother first. She did not go down to her husband.
</p>
<p>Then his father began to dance. After he had done so for a while, he fell down. At
once he broke in two in the middle. Out of his buttocks feathers blew, and out of
his trunk as well. One of the servants stood up out of his buttocks, one out of his
trunk, another <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>out of his buttocks, another out of his trunk. All ten whom he had eaten he restored.<a class="noteRef" id="n158.17src" href="#n158.17">17</a> That was why he danced. On account of the hat he had devoured the servants. He had
put grease, too, into the mind of the chief’s daughter by thinking. On account of
the hat they put her in the cave. By and by he came together. He stopped dancing.
He sat down.
</p>
<p>Now they put more wood on the fire, made them sit down in a circle, and began to give
them something to eat. The feast went on even until midnight, when they stopped. They
stopped. They went to bed.
</p>
<p>When day began to break the young hair seals cried in the very place where they had
cried before. Then they prepared to start from the top of the retaining timbers, where
their canoes were lying.
</p>
<p>Then her father-in-law called her. “Noble woman,<a class="noteRef" id="n158.18src" href="#n158.18">18</a> wait until I give you directions.” And he whispered to her. He gave her directions
as she sat near him. “Chief-woman, I will come forth from your womb. Do not be afraid
of me.” And to her he gave a round plate of copper, to which some strings and a chain
were fastened. It was named <span lang="hax">X̣īłūtꜝā′ła</span> (Property chain (?)). “Have Master Carpenter make my cradle, chief’s daughter. Let
lofty cumulus clouds be around the upper edges, chief-woman, and around its lower
edges short ones. In those days human servants (i.e., human beings) will gather food
through me. When they see me sitting in the morning the surface birds will gather
food while I am governing the weather (i.e., while I am in sight).”<a class="noteRef" id="n158.19src" href="#n158.19">19</a>
</p>
<p>Her parents (“fathers”) were waiting for her on top of the retaining timbers, but,
below, her father-in-law was giving her directions, to which she was listening. After
he had ceased talking, she got into the canoe with her father. They fastened the canoes
to each other; they all fastened themselves. After the chief’s child got in, all forgot
themselves. When they came to, they were afloat upon the ocean.
</p>
<p>At once they started off. In a short time he came to his village. After it had lain
still for a long time the chief’s daughter became pregnant. When she began to labor
they made a house for her outside. They drove in a stake, had her take hold of it,
and went in. Now he came forth, and, when she looked at him, she saw something wonderful.
Something flat stuck out from his eyelids. She rose quickly and ran away from him
in fright. “Awaiyā′,” she said, and the town was nearly overturned.
</p>
<p>Then she quickly turned back toward him, laid her hands upon him, and exclaimed as
she picked him up: “Oh! my grandfather, it is I.” The town was as still as when something
is suddenly thrown down. She brought him to the house. Her father put hot stones into
a urinal he owned, and they washed him.<a class="noteRef" id="n158.20src" href="#n158.20">20</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>As soon as they went out for [Master Carpenter], he came on the run. He held in his
hand what he had taken off (i.e., cut out)<a class="noteRef" id="n159.21src" href="#n159.21">21</a> in the woods. As soon as he came in he put the drawing on it, as the chief’s daughter
told him. He pictured the clouds upon it. There were two rows of them. He made holes
in the cradle for fastening the rope alongside of his legs.
</p>
<p>Then they put him in. They brought out two sky blankets and wrapped them round him
in the cradle. After that was done they launched the canoe. Five persons and the chief’s
daughter went with her son. Then they started seaward. They went, they went, they
went. When they found by looking about that they were midway between the Haida country
and the mainland they let him down into the water. When they let him go he turned
around to the right four times and became like something flat thrown down. Then they
went away from him, and settled down at the place where they had been before.
</p>
<p>[He was the one who has his place in the middle of the sea. Sometimes when sickness
was about to break out they saw him. <span lang="hax">Nᴀñʟ̣da′ sʟas</span><a class="noteRef" id="n159.22src" href="#n159.22">22</a> was a reef.]
</p>
<p>[What follows is really a second story, but it was told as part of the same. Its true
name is said to be “He-who-had-Panther-woman-for-his-mother.”]
</p>
<p>Here on the Nass lay the town of Gu′nwa. Four slaves of the owner of the town came
down [the inlet] after wood. They cut the wood at a sandy beach below the town and
saw young cedars. They found them for the chief’s wife. They did not believe their
eyes [for joy at finding them growing so conveniently to the water]. They finished
cutting the wood, loaded it on their canoe, and went up with the tide. At evening
they got back. The town people brought in the wood, and he (the chief) called them
in.
</p>
<p>Then, after they had given away food for a while, he reported that they had seen young
cedars. At once the chief’s wife planned to go for the bark. They went to sleep, and
early in the morning she had her husband’s canoe brought out. People of the town,
the <span class="corr" id="xd32e23004" title="Source: chiefs’">chief’s</span> daughters and young men, all went with her. At once they floated down with the current.
Hu hu hu hu hu, much food,—cranberries and salmon,—[they took with them]. Then they
went down.
</p>
<p>When they landed by the young cedars all the women pulled off and dragged down [the
bark] from those [trees] near by. They pulled it off and dragged it out to her. When
they had taken all from those near at hand they became scattered.
</p>
<p>She (the chief’s wife) sat with her back to the sunshine, pulling cedar bark apart.
She was not in the habit of eating much. Her fingers were slender. She did not care
for food.
</p>
<p>After the sounds of the voices of women and men had died away inland a person wearing
a bearskin blanket with the hair side out <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>came and stood near her. He held something like a pole. It had a sharp point. It was
half red, half blue. He was looking at the chief’s wife, but she did not even glance
toward him. He asked the chief’s wife: “How do you act when your husband calls the
people [for a feast]?” “When my husband calls the people, I empty the whole dish placed
in front of the one sitting next to me into my mouth.”
</p>
<p>She had children. One of the two boys she had could not creep.
</p>
<p>“How do you act when your husband calls the people again?” “As soon as my husband
calls the people I put food into the dishes and, bending down, eat out of them.” “How
do you act when your husband comes in from fishing?” “I go down, pull up my dress,
swim out to him, and swallow the two spring salmon which are on top.”
</p>
<p>He drove the thing he had in his hand into her forehead, and, when it stuck out at
the back of her head and he had raised her arm, all of her flesh dropped off. Then
he sat down and entered it (her skin). And he picked up her flesh and buried it in
the sand at the foot of the tree. After he had seated <span class="sic">herself</span> in the place of the chief’s wife, they came down to <span class="sic">her</span> in crowds with the cedar bark.
</p>
<p>All of them pulled their cedar bark apart. Among the crowds of people that were there
the chief woman did it. “Woman, I am hungry.” “Well, there is a piece of white food
in [my box].” “In mine, too.” “In mine, too.” This [they said] because they wanted
to have her eat.
</p>
<p>The one who was quickest broke up the piece of food and placed it in front of her.
She ate all of the little they gave her. While she was doing it, at which they were
very much pleased, they started out. Later than the usual time for going to sleep
they reached home. They explained that they had started back in the night because
the chief’s wife had begun to eat.
</p>
<p>The chief commanded wood to be put on the fire. Then he called the people. One of
her children had nearly cried itself to death when she reached home. When they handed
it to her she pulled her teats out and put one into her child’s mouth, but it ran
away from her. It was sucking a man. That is why it ran off crying.
</p>
<p>The town people came in and sat down in a circle. After they had roasted the salmon,
had broken it up into small pieces, and had placed some in a dish in front of the
one sitting next to her she emptied it all [into her mouth]. She did not chew it.
When she emptied it into her mouth the town people looked at her instead of eating.
They were astonished at the way in which she handled the food. But it was the chief’s
wife [they thought].
</p>
<p>Next day his wife was again hungry, and again he called the people. While they were
in astonishment at her [actions], the elder brother carried his younger brother along
in front of the town. Both went crying along. He called the people. Then they let
her pour the berries into <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>a dish. To their surprise instead of doing so she bent over the tray. The youths came
back in a crowd with the empty trays. They were astonished at what she did. It was
not the chief’s wife that they saw.
</p>
<p>Next day, very early, he (the elder brother) launched one of his father’s canoes and
put his younger brother in the bow. He paddled off aimlessly out of Nass inlet, away
from the town of Gu′nwa. After he had gone down with the tide for a while a woman
leaned halfway out from a certain house and said: “Come hither.” The house had a front
sewed together with cedar limbs.<a class="noteRef" id="n161.23src" href="#n161.23">23</a> It was painted.
</p>
<p>Then he directed his course toward it. After he had landed she said to him: “Stop
with me. To-morrow you shall go on.” She spread out mats woven in many colors for
them. The chief-woman sat on one side, the elder brother next to her, and the younger
lay on the other side of him. Then she said to him: “Let your younger brother sit
next to me.” He picked him up and made him sit next to her.
</p>
<p>For a long time he had had nothing to eat, since the time when they were astonished
at the actions of his mother. He was going to eat for the first time with this woman.
She turned round. Then she looked into her box, took a dish out of it with the carving
of a mouse on it, and placed before him a single piece of salmon.
</p>
<p>He bent down his head and thought: “After I have gone hungry for so long this is very
little for me to eat. What part will my brother eat?” She was looking at his face
and said to him: “Why, just as it is, the supernatural beings are never able to pick
it up and eat it.” He picked it up, and his younger brother also picked it up. Yet
it was still there. After they had eaten it for a while they had enough and put [the
dish] back.
</p>
<p>After the dry fish was finished she put down a cranberry for them as well. As soon
as he thought about that, too, she looked into his face again and said to him: “Eat
it. The supernatural beings are unable to consume it.” Then he picked it up with a
spoon and ate it. When they were filled she put it back.
</p>
<p>After it became dark she spread out the mat. There the chief-woman lay down. The elder
brother was going to lie next to her, but she said: “Lay your younger brother next
me.” He picked him up and laid him next her. As soon as he laid him down he lay as
still as one killed by a club. For the first time after he had cried so long he slept.
</p>
<p>While he (the elder brother) was asleep he heard a woman laugh, and it awoke him.
To his surprise his younger brother was playing with the chief-woman. When his younger
brother did a certain thing to the chief woman [she exclaimed]: “Yu-ī′, now see how
He-who-came-to-have-Panther-woman-for-his-mother plays with me.” As soon <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>as the elder brother understood this he began to cry [from jealousy]. At the same
time day broke.
</p>
<p>At daybreak he began to get ready to go somewhere without knowing whither. Then she
made him sit down. “Stop! let me tell you something.” She brought her box out to the
fire, took something blue out of it, and bit off part for him. “Now, my grandson,
if anything has too much power for you, swallow this and spit it upon yourself.” Then
she said to him: “Right down the inlet lives the one whom you came to see, the one
for whose daughter you came. But your younger brother shall remain with me, and after
a while I will marry him.”
</p>
<p>Then he went down with the current alone. He was expecting to meet Sqä′g̣ał’s daughter.
There lay the large town in which lived the woman he came to marry. After he had walked
about in the town for a while it became dark. Then he entered Sqä′g̣ał’s house. He
went in and sat down close to the door. The chief’s child sat between the screens
at the rear of the house. Around her walked some women with their hair stuck together
in bunches. Her father set them to watch her so that she might do nothing foolish.
When day began to break, instead of going in to her, he went outside.
</p>
<p>He went round the front of the house and followed a narrow trail. At an open place
near water holes human bones were piled up, and a bull pine stood there. In the branches
of this he sat down. After he had been sitting there for some time red spots from
the rising sun appeared on the open ground. Then the chief’s child came thither. The
servant who came in advance had a bone stuck in her nose.<a class="noteRef" id="n162.24src" href="#n162.24">24</a> She had a crooked war club. The one who came behind was dressed in the same way.
The leader had a human scalp in her hands. Their hair was stuck together in bunches.
She was a Tlingit woman. The one behind was a Bellabella.<a class="noteRef" id="n162.25src" href="#n162.25">25</a>
</p>
<p>She sat down, untied her blanket, and was naked. Then she went into the water, turned
round four times, and came out. Then the Tlingit woman rubbed her back. The Bellabella
woman, too, rubbed her breast. After they had finished rubbing her she went into the
water a second time. After she had turned round to the right she sat down on dry ground
and turned her back to the sunshine.
</p>
<p>When her skin had begun to dry he came out and seized her. The moment that he seized
her he quickly touched noses.<a class="noteRef" id="n162.26src" href="#n162.26">26</a> One servant picked up her weapons with the scalp, ready to strike him, and the other
one, too, was ready to strike him with the bone club. But she stopped them. “Do not
kill him. I will marry him.” The human bones lying around belonged to those who, having
become fascinated at the sight of her, had seized her, and had presently been killed
by the servants.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the same place, beside the bull pine, they lay with each other. The Tlingit woman
sat down at her feet. The Kwakiutl woman sat at her head. There they kept looking
at her. When the sun was set all four went home. Then she entered her father’s house.
As she went in she concealed her husband under her blankets. Her father had his eyes
fixed upon her and [said]: “My child, what makes you lame?” “Father, a shell made
my foot sore by cutting into it.” Then they went in together behind the screens.
</p>
<p>And in the evening the chief’s child lay behind the screens. Then he lay with her,
and he (her father) heard someone talking with his daughter in the night. When day
broke the chief commanded them to put wood on the fire, and two slaves put wood on
the fire. After it had begun to burn up he said: “Come! look to see who is talking
with my child.” Then a young man went thither and said: “Someone is lying here with
her.” And her father said: “Alas! I wonder what roaming supernatural being it is!
Perhaps it is ‘He-who-had-Panther-woman-for-his-mother,’ whom I wanted my child to
marry.” “He says he is the one, father [said his daughter].”
</p>
<p>Then he spread out a mat next to himself and said: “My child, come and sit down near
the fire with your husband.” Shortly she came down and sat there with him. They put
four hard stones into the fire. When they became red-hot he put them into a dish standing
near the wall with the tongs. Then he had it set before his son-in-law. A spoon made
out of white rock was stuck into it. She was crying. “Hᴀ hᴀ hᴀ!” she wept, “he is
going to do again as he always does when I try to get married. That is how he kills
them.” Then he said to his wife, “Do not utter a word.”
</p>
<p>Now he took the spoon, picked up one of the red-hot stones and swallowed it. His insides
were not affected. He handled all four in the same way. He finished with them.
</p>
<p>This was because his supernatural power was strong. If his supernatural power had
been weak, he would have been killed. Because his supernatural power was strong he
let him marry his daughter.
</p>
<p>While he was living with this woman he and his younger brother, who had become the
husband of Mouse-woman, forgot how their mother had begun to act strangely.
</p>
<p>One day he lay abed a long time. He lay until evening. He was there when they went
to sleep. Next day he again lay abed. Again he was there till they went to sleep.
He lay abed two days. “My child” [said his father-in-law], “why is your husband feeling
badly?” She said: “I do not know.” Then she went over to her husband, sat down at
the head of his bed, and talked a while to him. Then she said to her father: “He has
suddenly become desirous to see his younger brother, whom he left just above here.”
“Now, chief-woman, <span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>go with your husband to the common canoe I own over there in the woods.”
</p>
<p>And they went thither. To their surprise they did not find the canoe. Only the bones
of a whale lay there among the salmon-berry bushes. Its tail bones lay [with the rest].
Then they returned and she said to her father: “Father, we could not find it. Only
a whale’s head lies there.” Then he said to her: “Chief-woman, my daughter, that was
it. Say to it ‘Go seaward, father’s canoe.’ ”
</p>
<p>When she went back to it with her husband she kicked it. “Go seaward, father’s canoe,”
she said to it. Now a whale canoe floated upon the water. The lines cut on the edges<a class="noteRef" id="n164.27src" href="#n164.27">27</a> were pictures of geese, which almost moved their wings. And they carried their stuff
down to it. The canoe was all filled with good food, with cranberries, berries in
cakes, soapberries, and the fat of all kinds of animals, grizzly-bear fat, mountain-goat
fat, deer fat, ground-hog fat, beaver fat—the fat parts of all mainland animals; and
he got into the canoe and pressed it down with his feet toward the bow. When the canoe
was nearly full those who were loading it went up to the house and laid pieces of
whale meat, with most of the grease taken out, in a basket. When it was full they
took it down. And they laid it on the top.
</p>
<p>When they were ready to start, her father came out; [he said]: “My child, when the
creatures seated on both sides call throw cranberries into their mouths. When they
become hungry they keep calling.”
</p>
<p>As soon as they moved their wings the canoe started. While they did so the canoe went
along. By and by, when his brother’s wife’s house came in sight, they shoved off Mouse-woman’s
canoe also. They also loaded her’s with good food. When it was filled they pressed
it toward the bow with their feet. By and by it was filled, and they started off together.
</p>
<p>As soon as the geese along the edges of the elder brother’s canoe began to call he
took out cranberries and put them into their mouths. Along the edges of the younger
one’s canoe sat rows of small human figures. All had small painted paddles in their
hands. With these they paddled. As soon as they began to move their lips as if hungry
he fed them.
</p>
<p>When they came near to the place where they had gone to get cedar bark, the younger
brother’s wife and the elder brother’s wife sat upright. And they said: “Move shoreward.”
Now they got off there. They had sticks in their hands, and they hunted in the sand
with them from the sea inland. By and by they dug out the bones of a human being in
front of a tree at the edges of the grass. The canoes floated on the water in front
of them. Their husbands were looking at them.
</p>
<p>Mouse-woman took out her box. Sqäg̣ał’s daughter, too, took out her box. Sqäg̣ał’s
daughter brought out of her box a mat with edges <span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>like clouds. Mouse-woman took out something from her box also and bit off a part.
Now they put the mat over her and began to rattle her bones under it. Underneath this
Mouse-woman spit many times. Then they (i.e., Mouse-woman) told Sqäg̣ał’s daughter
to hurry: “Quick, hasten your mind, noble woman.” Then she, too, said: “It is [for
you to do so], noble woman. You had better hurry yourself; it is getting late.” Then
she pulled off the mat. Ah! their mother-in-law got up. He looked at his mother; both
[boys], in fact, [did so].
</p>
<p>They had her get into the canoe of the younger and went up with the tide to Gunwa,
their father’s town. The younger brother’s wife hid her mother-in-law. They were anxious
to see how their [supposed] mother would act when they arrived. When they got near
the town, the wife of the younger ordered the canoes to be brought close together.
The town was thrown into commotion. They reported to each other that the chief’s son
and his younger brother, who had gone away, had both married. The people who came
down to meet them were like warriors going to fight. In front came his mother putting
her belt on as she ran to carry up the things. She acted differently from the others.
</p>
<p>Then the elder brother’s canoe landed first, and Sqäg̣ał’s daughter stood near the
basket. “Come hither, woman. Carry up my basket.” Then she went to it and was going
to carry it with the strings around her head. Sqäg̣ał’s daughter prevented her. She
wished her to carry it the right way [with the straps around her breast]. When she
carried it, the weight made her stagger as she went up. She got into the house with
it. How huge it was! Afterward they at once carried up the other things.
</p>
<p>After they had pulled up the canoe, the younger one’s canoe also came to the shore.
A big basket was in it, the strings on which were just like a knife. Mouse-woman stood
near it. Then she called her mother-in-law from the place where she was carrying things
up. “Come hither, woman. Carry up my basket.” Then her mother-in-law came to her,
and was about to put the basket strings around her head. But [the other] forbade her.
And she did as she was told.
</p>
<p>When she started to carry it up the strings cut her head off. Her head lay at some
distance. At once Mouse-woman took a whetstone out of her box, quickly got ashore,
and put it between her head and her trunk, which were drawing together. After she
had ground herself to pieces foam was piled up on either side.
</p>
<p>Now she let out her mother-in-law. At that time they came down in a crowd and got
her. They did it because they were glad to see her. To kill her mother-in-law was
the purpose for which Mouse-woman let herself marry the boy. A crowd of people carried
the property up. Then she said to her husband: “Leave me. I married <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>you to restore your mother to life.” At once she pushed the canoe off and vanished
downstream with the current. There was no trace of her left.
</p>
<p>After that the elder brother’s wife lived as a chief’s wife. Then she became pregnant,
Sqäg̣ał’s daughter did. She bore a boy. Again she was pregnant. She bore another boy.
[She bore seven boys.] There was one girl.
</p>
<p>Sqäg̣ał’s children made their town at Qꜝadō′, opposite <span class="corr" id="xd32e23105" title="Source: Metlakatla">Metlakahtla</span>. Their mother and their sister lived with them. All eight went out to a beaver pond
to hunt. When they had at length come to the lake, and had made a hole in one end
of the dam, a stick was carried into the shoulder of the eldest by the force of the
current. He died there.
</p>
<p>Then they went away. And at midnight they came behind the house. Then they sent out
the youngest and gave him the following directions: “Speak to our mother. And also
watch your elder brother’s wife. She must be unfaithful to him. She must be going
with another man. That is why our brother is [dead].”
</p>
<p>He went off, entered his mother’s side of the house, laid his hand on his mother’s
head, and said to his mother: “The beaver dam drifted down upon my elder brother.
One piece drifted into his neck. He dropped dead without speaking a word.” Then she
said: “Alas! my child.” “Stop! we do not want him spoken of before the people. Do
not say a word.”
</p>
<p>When she had wakened the people in the house by her exclamation, they asked her: “What
made you say that?” and she said, “I dreamed of something terrible. I dreamed that
a beaver dam floated into my eldest son and he dropped dead without saying a word.
That was what made me cry out.”
</p>
<p>After he had lain flat on the floor near his mother, and midnight had come, he heard
some one talking with his elder brother’s wife. When it was near daylight, they stopped
whispering. Then he crept over to them. And as the man slept he cut off his head.
</p>
<p>After they had sat there in the woods for a while day came, and they went home. They
had a real human head in their hands. The youngest brother put his head above the
door. Out of it blood oozed in drops.
</p>
<p>The chief’s son [in Metlakahtla] was lost, and they were looking for him everywhere.
They stopped inquiring for him. The town of Metlakahtla lay there. By and by a north
wind began to blow. The sea surface froze, even to Qꜝadō′. They began to walk to and
fro to each other on the ice.
</p>
<p>Very early one morning a slave went to the town of Qꜝadō′ for live coals. “Enter the
middle house,” they said to him. And when he went in blood dropped upon his feet.
When he pushed the charcoal into the fire, he turned his head around from looking
at the side opposite <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>the door. Above the door, to his astonishment, he saw the head of the chief’s son
who had disappeared. He recognized him by the abalone-shell earrings he wore.
</p>
<p>He picked up the live coals and started away with them. When he came to the ice he
threw the coals away. Then he returned. Though he had looked right at it, he did not
believe himself. And he went in again, and again he put the coals into the fire. After
he had looked about the house for a while he fastened his eyes upon it again. It was
really the chief’s son. Then he went away with the burning coals.
</p>
<p>When he was halfway back he also threw those coals away. He thought: “I must have
been mistaken.” Then he went back again. He entered, and he put [fresh charcoal] into
the fire. And as soon as he had done so, he looked. It was truly he. He saw with his
eyes. Then he started off with the burning coals.
</p>
<p>Just outside he threw them away. At once he ran off shouting. “The head of the chief’s
son who disappeared forever is stuck up in this house,” he shouted out as he ran.
As soon as they heard his voice from the town they did not delay. They put on their
armor, shields, helmets. And they ran to fight with war spears and bows and arrows.
At once they fought with Sqäg̣ał’s children.
</p>
<p>She and her mother were the only ones from among her kindred who were saved. Her brothers,
however, they destroyed. They (the two women) came to live in a branch house in front
of a hill behind the town. She lived there some time with her daughter. Every evening
she cried. They went to bed, and they continued to lie there.
</p>
<p>One day she offered her daughter in marriage: “<span lang="hax">Djīnâ′-â-â, <span class="corr" id="xd32e23127" title="Source: nałgū-ū-ūłs">nałgū-ū-ūs</span> Ga′oax</span> (Tsimshian words).”<a class="noteRef" id="n167.28src" href="#n167.28">28</a> A large creature came running in at the side toward the door. “I will marry your
daughter.” “What will you do when you marry my daughter?” “Oh, bother! after I have
married your daughter I will come out at one end of the town and eat them all up from
the end. I will eat them all.” That was Grizzly-bear.
</p>
<p>At once she said the same thing again: “<span lang="hax">Djīnâ′-â-â, djīnâ′-â-â nałgū-ū-ūs Ga′oax.</span>” Something with crooked legs came in. “I will marry your daughter.” “After you have
married my daughter what will you do for us?” “I will tip the town over by digging
it up with my teeth.” That was Beaver.
</p>
<p>“<span lang="hax">Djīnâ′-â-â, djīnâ′-â-â nałgū′-ū-ūs Ga′oax.</span>” “What will you do after you have married my daughter?” “I [will] run into the water
at the end of the town. Then they [will] take me into some canoe, and I [will] make
them quarrel. Then all the townspeople will kill each other.” That was Deer.
</p>
<p>Still another time [she cried]: “<span lang="hax">Djīnâ′-â-â, djīnâ′-â-â nałgū-ū-ūs Ga′oax.</span>”<a class="noteRef" id="n167.29src" href="#n167.29">29</a> Someone came in and stood there. He had a bow for a staff. Feathers were around it
in one place. He held arrows with <span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>it in his hand. He had a quiver on his back. He had dancing leggings. He had a gable-crowned
hat. He did not say a word. “What are you going to do if you marry my daughter?” He
took a heavy step with his right foot. The earth cracked. “Stop! stop! great chief,
you are the one.” Then the earth closed again. “Indeed, I thought that you had your
daughter for me.”
</p>
<p>He took off his hat. He laid aside his quiver. He started off with only two arrows
and his bow. He rolled a grizzly bear down from a steep place with his foot. There
he also rolled down a deer and a beaver. Again he started off. He brought a post out
on his shoulder. He put it into the ground, and without waiting, pulled it out. He
went to the other side and did the same thing there, also toward the door, and on
the other side. There he let it stay.
</p>
<p>Again he went off. He brought out a wall post. In the rear of the house he stuck it
in, in the other corner, on the side toward the door, in the corner opposite to that.
</p>
<p>He went off. He brought out a stringer. He put it up and, after he had moved it backward
and forward a while, he took it over to the other side. He put it up on the wall posts,
too, and on the opposite side. There he let it stay.
</p>
<p>Again he went off. He brought a plank out on his shoulder. He set it up on edge above
the side opposite the door, and he rolled it over. By doing this again and again he
completed half [of the roof]. He did the same to the other half of the roof. He filled
up that, too.
</p>
<p>Again he went away. He brought out a wall plank. He stood it up, shoved it along,
and one side of the front was filled. He treated the other side and the side opposite
the door in the same way. He treated both sides of the house in the same way.<a class="noteRef" id="n168.30src" href="#n168.30">30</a>
</p>
<p>The house was finished. He went away. He brought two white rocks. He rubbed them against
each other and laid them down under the smoke hole. The fire burned continually. It
was never extinguished.
</p>
<p>After that his mother-in-law kept cutting up and bringing in mountain goats and grizzly
bears. Afterward she cooked them. He took his quiver and his bow. He put on his hat,
took up his wife, and went away with her. He was the son of One-who-goes-along-above
(i.e., the moon).
</p>
<p>After he had lived with her in his father’s house for a while he had a child by her.
She bore a boy. Again she gave birth to a boy. [She gave birth to eight.] Again she
gave birth. She gave birth to [two] girls. The eldest son was called “Puncher” (<span lang="hax">X̣ᴀtagī′a</span>).<a class="noteRef" id="n168.31src" href="#n168.31">31</a> The youngest girl was called “One-who-sucks-arrow-points-from-wounds.” The next one
he named “One-who-heals-the-place-where-the-arrows-strike.” His grandfather called
the eldest boy to him, took out his bones, and put stones in in place of them. He
filled up all parts of his body with stones.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day he gave ten slaves to the eldest. To the next he also gave ten slaves. He
gave ten apiece to all eight. He made a row of houses for them, all sewed together
with cedar limbs. On the house front of the eldest he put the figure of a thunder-bird.
On that of the next one he put the figure of a sculpin. On that of the next he put
the figure of a rainbow. On that of the next he put the figure of a killer whale.
On that of the next he put the figure of a human being. On that of the next one he
figured stars. On that of the next he put the figure of a cormorant. On that of the
next he put the figure of a sea gull. To the eldest brother he gave a spear box. Along
with it he gave an arrow box. He gave to all eight of them in the same way. Then he
put two marten-skin blankets around each of their two sisters.
</p>
<p>He sat in front of his grandchildren’s town and called for them. Then they picked
up their weapons and practised fighting each other. By and by one was shot. Then the
elder sister went out and sucked the arrow out of him. The younger sister went thither,
spit on her palms, and rubbed them on him. Immediately he was fighting among the ten.
Both [of the women] walked about among them. They tried particularly to shoot them.
Instead of penetrating, the weapons rebounded from the blankets. That was why he gave
the blankets to them. Thus they turned out good [warriors], and he had them cease
fighting.
</p>
<p>One day he began to let his grandchildren’s town down. He pulled apart the heavy floor
planks, looked down, and saw the houses of Metlakahtla and [the site of] <span lang="hax">Qꜝadō′</span> among human beings. At midnight he let down the house of the eldest. When it struck
the ground there was a sound of rattling planks. From the town of Metlakahtla one
cried “<span lang="hax">Wā-ā-ā-ā-ā</span>, ghosts are settling down”. So he heard some one cry. He let down two of them. He
let down three.
</p>
<p>The youngest received the following directions from his grandfather: “When you run
away because they are too much for you put a wooden wedge having a drawing on it into
the fire for me. Say to it ‘Tell my grandfather.’ ”
</p>
<p>All that time the Metlakahtla people shouted “<span lang="hax">Wā-ā-ā-ā-ā</span>, ghosts are coming down.” Eight had come down. It was wonderful to see smoke rolling
from them in the daylight. In front of the town people walked about in crowds. They
wore feathers in their hair. They longed much to see them. Then they sent a slave
across in a canoe for live coals. They told him to go into the middle house, which
had the figure of a thunder-bird on it.
</p>
<p>He landed in front and shoved his coals into the fire. To his surprise he recognized
Ga′oax there cooking parts of an animal. It was she whose sons they had killed. From
rear to front gambling was in progress. Those watching the gambling stood about in
crowds. He <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>looked on. She (i.e., Ga′oax) threw a fat piece of meat to him [saying]: “Here is
some ghosts’ food for you to taste.”
</p>
<p>He went out. Then he threw away the burning coals and paddled across. He reached home,
but instead of eating the fat he carried it up. He entered his master’s house and
said: “Say! did you kill Ga′oax?” At once they called all the town people, and they
questioned one another: “Did you kill Ga′oax?” Some said “Yes;” some, “No.” Some thought
that she had got safely into the woods.
</p>
<p>While they were still in the house one, full of mischief,<a class="noteRef" id="n170.32src" href="#n170.32">32</a> bit off some of the mountain goat meat. They looked to see him drop dead where he
stood. Presently he said: “Why, it passed into me all right. All of you taste it.
Swallow it. This is human beings’ food.”
</p>
<p>One among them said: “Well! let us gamble with them. Then you can see whether Ga′oax
got safely into the woods.” With that intention they went to bed, and next day, early
in the morning, the town chief launched his canoe. The town, the chiefs and the middle-aged,
all went. They went across.
</p>
<p>After they had landed there they went into the middle house, and those who were gambling
put away their gambling sticks. At once they began gambling with these instead. The
town chief started to gamble with the elder brother. But Ga′oax spread out grizzly
bear skins around the inside of the house. She and the young people began to give
them food.
</p>
<p>The elder brother was left-handed. He had laid the gambling-sticks down on that side.
On the same side lay his bone club. After gambling had gone on for some time he stopped
the town chief, who was handling the sticks. “You are cheating me” [he said]. And
he replied: “No, indeed; I am not cheating you.” In spite of that he insisted upon
it for a long time. After they had disputed for some time, the town chief threw fine
cedar bark into his face. Then he struck him on the head with his war club. He killed
him.
</p>
<p>The house was in an uproar. They picked up their weapons, and the Metlakahtla people
as well. They began to fight. While the fighting went on the two sisters walked about
among them. Although they were struck with the spears, the latter always broke upon
them. After the fight had gone on for a while one had an arrow point break off in
him. He was wounded badly. When he was about to lie down the elder sister sucked his
wound and sucked it out. Then the other sucked it, spit upon her hand, and rubbed
on the wound. Then he got up again and fought with them.
</p>
<p>The fight went on until the dawn of the next day, and continued then and the day after.
Now they began to drive the people of Qꜝadō′ back. When that happened the youngest
brother ran over to the house, drew something upon a partly used wooden wedge, said
to it: “Carry the news to my grandfather,” and threw it into the fire.<a class="noteRef" id="n170.33src" href="#n170.33">33</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then it at once came into the front part of the house and said: “Your grandchildren
are beginning to be hard pressed.” Now he looked down between the floor planks. To
his surprise his grandchildren, who were fighting for revenge, were being driven back.
The eldest brother was naked. He fought among them with his fists. When he struck
one, he did not get up again. He looked down upon all this. He turned around, went
to get his small, square box and, when he had opened five boxes, one within the other,
he took from the last something [shaped like skeins of yarn], covered with the sky
and tied up with rope. After he had looked down for a while, he threw it down upon
the people of Metlakahtla. Then their legs only were visible. At these they struck,
and they killed all. These were called Clouds-of-the-Killer.<a class="noteRef" id="n171.34src" href="#n171.34">34</a>
</p>
<p class="small">Although this is the second story of the Skedans series, it was the first of them
that I took down, my informant choosing to tell the Raven story last, and it is the
second Haida story recorded by me. In consequence, the form in which it appears is
rougher than that of most of the others, and certain points will seem obscure at the
first reading. As noted in the text and translation, there are really two stories
combined under one head. To the first the name properly belongs, and this may be a
real Haida story, but the second, “He-who-had-Panther-woman-for-his-mother,” is a
well-known Tsimshian tale. Nevertheless, my informant stoutly maintained that the
story was always told in this combined form. Probably, the common episode of the marriage
of two chiefs’ sons to women having supernatural power was the occasion for placing
them together. The name given for Panther-woman, Sîmn’â′sᴀm, is Tsimshian.

<h2 class="main"><span class="sc">The one abandoned for eating the flipper of a hair seal</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by John Sky of Those-born-at-Skedans]
</p>
<p>He was a chief’s son. He was always in the back part of his father’s house whittling.
He did not care to eat anything. [His father] owned the town of Metlakahtla.<a class="noteRef" id="n173.1src" href="#n173.1">1</a> He was “town-mother.”<a class="noteRef" id="n173.2src" href="#n173.2">2</a>
</p>
<p>Then someone in the town killed a hair seal. Then they cooked it and called the people
in for it. And the father of the boy who sat up whittling went thither. All the town
people went in for it. There they ate.
</p>
<p>As soon as they had stopped they carried some over to the chief’s wife. When they
brought it in a flipper lay upon the top. Now, he who sat up whittling looked down.
Then he came down and called to his mother: “Come, give me a wash basin. Let me wash
my hands.” Then he said “Come, push that over to me,” and he ate it. He ate it all
and pushed [the dish] back.
</p>
<p>Now he (the chief) came in and said to his wife “My child’s mother, come let me eat
the hair-seal flipper I sent home.” “My child has eaten that,” she said to her husband.
From the high place where he was whittling he heard what his mother said.
</p>
<p>After she had said this to her husband, he did not say a word. Presently he said “Well,
say that I want them to move from this place to-morrow.” At once a slave went out
and said, “To-morrow the chief says he is going to abandon his son.”
</p>
<p>Then evening came and he (the boy) went to the wife of one of his ten uncles with
whom he was in love. As he lay with her, she gave him the following directions: “When
they are ready to start, I will get off to defecate, and dig around with your feet
in the place where I sit. I will leave something for you there.”
</p>
<p>His younger brother was just big enough to sit up. He also had a dog.
</p>
<p>When morning came the noise of their departure was heard. Then, when they were ready
to go, he brought out his younger brother. He also took his dog, which he treated
like his child. When they were ready to start, his uncle’s wife got off to defecate.
She sat down behind the sea-weeds which were drifted ashore. As soon as she got in
again, they started off.
</p>
<p>After the crowd of canoes had gone round the point, he went to [the place where his
uncle’s wife had sat]. Only a broken stick lay there. Then he dug around. He dug up
a small box. It had ropes round it. He laid the box down near his younger brother,
gathered <span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>planks together, and made a house. He made it just large enough. When it was finished,
he again sat down near his younger brother and untied the strings of the box. In it
was a grease-box and two mussel-shells fastened together by a string, which he untied.
To his astonishment he found burning coals within.
</p>
<p>He looked into the grease-box. It was half full of grease. Cranberries were also in
it, and ten salmon were on the bottom of the box. He did not eat one of them. He kept
them all winter for his younger brother. But he whittled continually.
</p>
<p>Then only one salmon was left with a small amount of grease and cranberries. His mind
was greatly troubled. There was nothing for his younger brother to eat. He used to
give part to the dog. That is why his food was nearly gone. The last bits of the salmon,
grease, and cranberries were nearly gone. By and by a small piece [of fish] was left,
and he gave it to his younger brother along with all of the grease.
</p>
<p>In the evening he went to bed and wept, wept, wept. He kept thinking all night of
how nothing was left for his younger brother to eat. Presently his dog went out. It
barked behind the house. From where he lay by his younger brother he rose quickly
and at once seized his bow. While still in the house he wet the arrows with his mouth,
prepared his bow ready to shoot when outside, and stepped lightly in that direction.
</p>
<p>It was barking at something in the space between the roots of a cedar bent over toward
the sea. After he had gone toward it for a while he saw nothing near it. It was barking
at something in the ground. When he stood over it [he found] that it was barking at
something in a pool of water. To his surprise a salmon lay in it. He speared it with
an arrow. He twisted its neck off.
</p>
<p>He took it up, laid it down on a piece of board near the house, cut it open, and steamed
its head, its backbone, its milt, and its heart (?).<a class="noteRef" id="n174.3src" href="#n174.3">3</a> He gave its backbone and its head to his younger brother to eat. To the dog he gave
its milt and its heart (?) to eat. He, however, ate nothing.
</p>
<p>They went to bed and at daybreak the dog was barking there again. Again he went thither
with his bow and [found] it barking at something in the water. Two salmon lay there.
Then he speared them with an arrow. And after he had taken them to the house he steamed
the two backbones, the two heads, the milt of both, and he gave them to his younger
brother and the dog. He, however, again ate nothing.
</p>
<p>Next day it was barking there again. Then he got his bow. He wet the arrows with his
lips just outside. He went over and [found] three lying there. Every morning there
was one more. Finally ten lay there, and he speared them and pulled them out. He dragged
them out in a bunch and cut them open. He threw the gills away. <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>Those he had obtained the day before he split a second time. This is why it happens
that mainland chiefs cut fish open [instead of letting the women do it]. He was the
one who started [that custom].
</p>
<p>When it barked there the next day he stopped taking his bow. He only took the arrows.
Again there was one more. Next day there was also one more. In this way the number
reached twenty. Those he had cut open for the first time the day before he cut open
farther. Then he split planks and hung them up there. He fixed a place overhead. Some
food entered his belly for the first time since they left him, for his younger brother
now had enough to eat.
</p>
<p>The next day the dog barked there again. He went thither. There was one more than
before. The day after one more was added. In that way the number reached thirty.
</p>
<p>Next day the dog barked there. He went thither, and again there was one added. The
day after one more was added, and the number increased to forty.
</p>
<p>He and his younger brother again went to bed, and when day broke he heard the dog
go out. After he had listened to its barking for a while [he found] that it was barking
differently from the way in which it used to bark. After it had barked for a while
it yelped differently. Then he picked up his bow and two arrows and just outside wet
them with his lips. Having his bow in readiness he walked slowly toward [the sound].
</p>
<p>It was barking at something in the same pool of water, and he looked into it. He saw
not a sign of anything. But it dug for something near the water. After it had done
so for a while its teeth stuck fast in the roots, and after it had yelped a while
they slipped off. Then [the boy] helped dig behind it. The dog dug along ahead of
him. Ah! they dug into the marks of salt water, and a salmon creek came to be there.<a class="noteRef" id="n175.4src" href="#n175.4">4</a> At that time a great shoal of salmon came up. He stood near them. Then he went away,
collected the town people’s planks, and split them up. He planed them. He made notches
for ropes. All that time the salmon were coming steadily up. He made this for them.
</p>
<p>He stretched his arms on these. Each [of these horizontal pieces] was two fathoms
long. Some were one fathom long [for uprights]. There were twenty poles of each sort.
All had notches on the ends. Toward the top, which he worked down small, he placed
a design. He put figures of salmon there. These parts were the <span lang="hax">łg̣aiyî′ñgadadjî</span>.<a class="noteRef" id="n175.5src" href="#n175.5">5</a>
</p>
<p>While he was making this thing he never forgot his younger brother and the dog, they
say. He cooked for them continually, and they ate. When he had those things all together
he went away and dug some roots. Then he came back, made a large fire of dead branches,
and put them in. After it he split [twigs] with his teeth. After he had finished doing
this, he shaped young and slender hemlocks so that they <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>should be flat on one side and rounded on the other. When he had finished he fastened
these together. He had four horizontal crosspieces on each half of the <span lang="hax">gī′g̣awai</span>. On each half of the <span lang="hax">gīgwᴀ′ñgīda</span>, too, he had three crosspieces. On each of the <span lang="hax">łg̣aiyî′ñgadadjî</span> he had three crosspieces. He also split up pieces for the “wings” (<span lang="hax">weir</span>). After that he put them together and finished all the same day.
</p>
<p>He went back of the house, cut piles, sharpened them, and put rings of bark around
them [to keep them from splitting when they were driven into the stream bed]. Now
he went into the water and drove piles into the place where the fish trap was to stand.
Then he put the fish trap into the water. He fastened the horizontal pieces with twisted
cedar limbs. He treated the <span lang="hax">gīgwᴀ′ñgīda</span> in the same way. Now he stood up the <span lang="hax">łg̣aiyî′ñgadadjî</span> in place. Out of it all he made something roundish.<a class="noteRef" id="n176.6src" href="#n176.6">6</a>
</p>
<p>After he had put the fish trap in place he gathered planks together. Then he split
them in two. He also split some planks into poles. Then he enlarged the house. He
set the drying frames for salmon over each other. He also put up the large poles (<span lang="hax">qꜝa′idagilai</span>). They had notches [to prevent the smaller <span lang="hax">kꜝia′sᴀnai</span> from slipping off]. The <span lang="hax">taxasgā′gida</span> lay beneath the ridgepole of the house (<span lang="hax">djansgā′gida</span>), itself supported front and back by the crossed house-timbers.<a class="noteRef" id="n176.7src" href="#n176.7">7</a>
</p>
<p>Although he used to eat, he was so busy working that he stopped doing so. Still he
never forgot his younger brother and the dog. He fed them all the time. As soon as
the fish trap and all things were finished, and day came, he went to the fish trap.
He kept taking them (the salmon) out. As soon as he had done so he strung them together.
He finished ten strings and laid them in the water. Then he roasted some for his younger
brother for that evening, and that night he remained awake. Again he kept taking them
out. He strung up the same number as on the day before and let them lie in the water.
All that time they never ceased to run, hu hu hu hu hu. Where had their hunger gone
to?
</p>
<p>One day, when the house was filled and he had fully enough and had cut them up for
more than ten nights, before he went out to remain awake, he roasted some for his
younger brother by the fire. He took out more and more salmon. He came back, and the
two rows of roasted fish which had been there were gone. Then he went over to his
younger brother, cried near him, and went out to cut up the fish.
</p>
<p>When it was evening he again roasted some. Again he had more and again he stayed up
to watch. He took some out. He did it repeatedly. When he went home what he had roasted
had again disappeared. Then he again wept near his younger brother and went out to
cut up his fish. He cut up the fish and again remained awake. Now he had three rows
of roasted fish.
</p>
<p>He took out still more salmon. He came in, and lo! all was gone. Part of those above
were also gone. Then he called his younger brother, <span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>and said: “Say! brother,<a class="noteRef" id="n177.8src" href="#n177.8">8</a> did you eat all the things I roasted?” “No; shortly after you went out someone came
in, gathered them up in his hands, with those above, and put them into his mouth.”
“I thought it was you.”
</p>
<p>Now, he did not care about the salmon. Nor did he go out to cut up the fish. He felt
badly. He sat waiting. He was going to watch. He wanted to see who this person was.
In the evening he brought out his bow, spanned it, brought out two arrow-boxes, put
one on the left side near the door, and sat over the right-hand one with his bow.
</p>
<p>After he had sat there in the dark for a while he saw two pieces of burning pitchwood
side of the house. When they came around to the front of the house something wonderful
entered and stood there. Something with fire burning in its eyes came in and stood
there. After it had stood there for a while it gathered the roasted salmon together
and swallowed all. After he had stood looking at those above for a while he gathered
them also together and swallowed them. As he turned away from this he (the boy) shot
him under the armpit and from the other side as well. That was <span lang="hax">Ga′ogila</span>.<a class="noteRef" id="n177.9src" href="#n177.9">9</a>
</p>
<p>When he turned about he shot him repeatedly. He shot him repeatedly. When one arrow-box
was exhausted, as the animal turned around, he went to the other also, and after he
had shot from it for a while midnight came and he went out.
</p>
<p>At once he pursued him. He stuck the arrows into his quiver, and kept shooting him
through his back and his breast. After some time had passed, lo! he had passed to
the other side of a mountain as quickly as if it had been thrown back from him. Then
he returned.
</p>
<p>He entered and took his younger brother on his knee. He also called the dog to him,
and the latter licked his lips. Then he turned over the drum that had belonged to
his father and placed it over his younger brother and the dog. And he went away.
</p>
<p>As he went he picked up the shafts of his arrows [which had fallen from the heads].
After he had run along for a while he heard a noise. Then he stood still. After he
had listened for a while he heard a sound like that of a hammer. Now, he went in that
direction. Lo! some one was working out the inside of a canoe. Only the top of his
head was visible. He looked at it fixedly.
</p>
<p>He walked slowly in that direction. His head entirely disappeared within the canoe
while his hammer lay outside of the canoe. Then he reached for it and took it with
him under a bunch of ferns near by. After he (the boy) had looked at him for a while
he stood up in the midst of his work and looked about for something. He cleared away
the chips. [The boy] was looking at him stealthily.
</p>
<p>He sat still and put his finger-nails between his teeth. By and by he said: “My grandson,
come to me. News of you has come. News <span class="pageNum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>has come, grandson, that they abandoned you because you ate the hair seal’s flipper,
which your father sent home from the feast. If it is you, come to me.”
</p>
<p>He went out quickly and stood there. And he handed his hammer to him. At once he stepped
out to take it. That was Master Carpenter<a class="noteRef" id="n178.10src" href="#n178.10">10</a> making a canoe.
</p>
<p>“Say! go and get four bent wooden wedges. Put two rings of cedar bark in the front
part of the canoe and two in the stern. Then your canoes will come apart.” He was
unable to make two canoes as he was trying to do, one inside the other, because his
wedges were too straight.
</p>
<p>He went to get the wedges, and while he was away the other had already put rings on
the canoe. He brought them (the wedges) along. Then he told him to put them in the
bow and the stern. Then he began hammering on them. After he had busied himself going
back and forth from one to another for a while, lo! they started to separate. After
doing so for a while, he hammered them apart. He thought: “I wonder where the salmon
are for which he wants these.” He did not think about his younger brother. Then [the
man] said to him: “Now, grandson, come with me. You shall marry my daughter.”
</p>
<p>Now he went with him. Wā, the smoke they came in sight of was like a comb. That was
his town. He went with him into the middle house, which belonged to Master Carpenter.
Between the screens, in the rear of the house, sat a wonderful creature, as beautiful
as a daughter of one of the supernatural beings. Then her father said to her, “Chief-woman,<a class="noteRef" id="n178.11src" href="#n178.11">11</a> my daughter, come and sit near your husband.” At once she arose and sat down near
him.
</p>
<p>After his father-in-law had given him something to eat repeatedly, evening came and
she said to him, “Let us go out [to defecate].” “I do not know where they go out.”
Then she said to him, “Why! do you not know where they go out?” She said to him, “I
will go with you.” It was evening, and she went out with him. She went seaward with
him, and they defecated. They came in and sat down. Straight across from the town
a drum sounded.
</p>
<p>His father-in-law treated him well. Every evening he went out with his wife, and the
drum kept sounding there. He became tired of hearing it and once, after he had gone
out and was seated with his wife, he questioned his wife, “Say! why is that drum always
beating?” “They are trying to cure the town chief.” Then he said to his wife, “Come!
let us go over and look.”
</p>
<p>Then they came in, and she asked her father: “Father, do you own a small canoe?” “Yes,
chief-woman, my daughter, one is lying down on the beach.” Then two youths carried
the canoe down on their shoulders, but they (the man and his wife) walked. They got
into it, and only the youths paddled, while he and his wife sat in the middle.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>They landed and pulled up the canoe. Then he and his wife went up and, when they saw
him, the crowd of spectators standing in front of the house before the door opened
up a passage for him, and he and his wife looked in.
</p>
<p>To his surprise the one he had shot sat doubled up over wooden bars which were fastened
between ropes hung from the ridge-pole, touching the lower one with his feet and holding
the upper one in his hands.<a class="noteRef" id="n179.12src" href="#n179.12">12</a> The arrows stuck out of him all over. He was suffering greatly.
</p>
<p>After he had looked at him for a while, he thought: “I wonder why the shaman does
not see what is sticking out of him.” Then one standing near him looked at his face
and said: “I wish you could hear what the person standing here says, ‘I wonder why
the shaman trying to cure him does not see what is sticking out of him.’ ” The one
who announced his thought was mind-reader among the Land-otter people. And a shaman
from among the Land-otter people was trying to cure him. He did not see what was sticking
out of him.
</p>
<p>By and by some one rose and spoke to him who offered the blankets in return for the
cure. Then he went away with his wife, came home, and told her to ask something of
her mother. “Mother, have you any cedar-bark?” “Yes, chief-woman, my daughter.” Then
she gave him some. They dried it around the fire, went to work upon it, and pounded
it up for cedar-bark rings. These were finished.
</p>
<p>Then they intended to bring him over. While yet in the house he bound himself [with
the bark]. He bound his arms, the front of his body and his legs. Then they came and
offered him ten moose-skins. Then they had him brought over. When he entered, the
sick man was still hanging in the rear of the house.
</p>
<p>And, after he had gone around him for a while, he pulled the arrows out of his buttocks.
As soon as he had done so he stuck them into the bands around his own arms. He suffered
ceaselessly where he hung. Then he pulled them out from the other side of him and
from his legs. He stuck them into the rings around his body and back. Then he picked
him up and seated him on the floor-planks. So he who had been unable to sit up now
did sit up. Then he asked for a pillow and laid him on it. Ah! he lay there comfortably.
</p>
<p>But, when he looked up, he beheld his (Ga′ogila’s) daughter, who was wonderful to
look upon. He beheld her. Then, picking the sick man up again, he made him lay his
feet upon the lower cross stick and seize the upper one with both hands. Then he put
the arrows back into his buttocks and his side, so that he again suffered severely.
Then he started away. He ceased looking at him, and they took him away on the canoe.
</p>
<p>After he came in and sat down two more persons came in and stood there. They offered
him twenty moose-skins and two coppers. He refused them. Then they came to offer him
all the things in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>town one after another. But he kept refusing them. Now he saw that his mind had become
fixed. His future father-in-law wanted to keep his daughter by means of the many things
he owned. And, after he had refused the property, he offered his daughter in marriage.
</p>
<p>Immediately he turned around and started off. Then he again bound [bark] around himself.
And they took him across. He entered and went round the man who was hung doubled up.
By and by, while he was doing it, he pulled the arrows out of his buttocks, and he
also pulled the arrow points out from the left side of his body. Then he took hold
of him and made him sit up. He sat there; and, when he had finished pulling the arrow
points out of his sides, back, and breast, not one was left in him. He sat up.
</p>
<p>Then he said to his daughter: “Chief-woman, my daughter, come hither and sit down
near your husband.” He married the chief’s daughter. At once Master Carpenter’s daughter
came over. Now he had two wives.
</p>
<p>After he had lived with his wives for a while, one day he lay abed. When the people
went to bed again he was still there. Next day he did the same thing. His two wives
said not a word to him. As he lay abed he wept.
</p>
<p>Then he (his father-in-law) asked his daughter:<a class="noteRef" id="n180.13src" href="#n180.13">13</a> “Chief-woman, my daughter, why does your husband lie abed?” Then she went to her
husband and talked with him a while. And she said to her father: “He lies abed because
he is homesick for his younger brother whom he left.” “Now, chief-woman, my daughter,
go away at once with your husband. You and your husband go and look for the canoe
I own which lies at the end of the town.”
</p>
<p>Then they went there together. They arrived. Only a whale’s head lay there. Then they
went home. She said to her father: “Father, there is only a whale’s head there.” “That
is it. Go and say to it ‘Seaward, father’s canoe.’ ”
</p>
<p>Lo! it floated on the water. Hu hu hu hu hu, it was a big canoe. Its edges were broad.
They had cross lines. Then they put good food into it, launched another for Master
Carpenter’s daughter, and into it put good food. They filled it with cranberries,
berry cakes, mountain-goat fat, all kinds of berries. Then they pulled the canoes
alongside and started off. Both wives accompanied him.
</p>
<p>When they got near the town site he spanned his bow. He held two arrows in readiness.
Then he jumped out of his canoe at a rocky point near the town, and he ran to his
own house. When he entered he pushed off the drum which he had placed over his younger
brother. The bones of his younger brother and the dog lay under it, held together
only by their joints.
</p>
<p>And, when the canoes landed, he went down to them. He held his bow ready to shoot
the daughter of Ga′ogila. Then she said to him, <span class="pageNum" id="pb181">[<a href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>“Do not kill us. We are going to look at your younger brother.” Then he stopped.
</p>
<p>They went up together and sat over his younger brother, Ga′ogila’s daughter took something
out of her box and bit off the end of it. It was blue. Then Master Carpenter’s daughter
brought out a mat with edges like cumulus clouds, and they laid his younger brother
upon it. Ga′ogila’s daughter spit under it many times.
</p>
<p>Then she told Ga′ogila’s daughter to hurry. Her copartner in marriage<a class="noteRef" id="n181.14src" href="#n181.14">14</a> said to her: “Do so yourself, woman. Hurry your own mind.” Then she pulled off the
mat. He rose out of the place [where he had been lying]. The dog, too, was glad to
see him.
</p>
<p>Then they unloaded both canoes. There were plenty of canoe men. There were a crowd
of those whom his fathers-in-law had given to him. And next day they enlarged the
house. They finished a large house for him. The front was sewn together [in the old
style].
</p>
<p>In his house they ate nothing but good food day after day. When they were through
eating deer fat, mountain-goat fat was brought out, cut up, and distributed. They
held this by the fire to roast. They ate it.
</p>
<p>One day they said to their husband: “Go and get digging sticks for us.” Then he was
glad. And he climbed a tree. He cut off limbs. He made them, and they were finished.
The digging sticks he made while still in the woods were partly bloody looking [where
the inside bark was reached]. When he came in with them, instead of being pleased,
they laughed at him and said, “Get a real digging stick like father’s.” He went away
again and used cedar limbs. Those the women also rejected. He got all sorts of sticks.
He was unsuccessful. Then he got the side shoot of a yellow cedar. He finished it
roughly on the spot. Then he brought it home and worked it up. The women said to him:
“Make the lower part red; make the upper part blue.” They were hung in the rear of
the house. The upper ends were made like round knobs.
</p>
<p>Next morning they ate. The crowd of people was like stirred up salmon eggs. The young
people played with his wives. But he said nothing. Then the two women put the digging
sticks on their shoulders, but they did not take baskets.
</p>
<p>Then he also went with them. The clams were shooting water. And he said, “Dig right
here.” When the women went there, he heard them laughing, and they made him ashamed.
But, after they had moved about for a while, they separated and started inland. Then
they stood still opposite each other at the ends of the town. They ran their digging
sticks into the ground. When they pried up they made the town larger than it was before.
They brought up his father-in-law’s village.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lo and behold! people walked about in front of the town in great numbers. He was “town
mother” in his father-in-law’s town. His wives were two. Next day they again went
down on the beach. When he spoke to them as before they laughed at him. They made
him ashamed again.
</p>
<p>After they had gone along for a while they struck their digging sticks into the ground.
They dug out two whales, and the town people went down and cut them up. Next day they
went down again. Again they dug two out. They went down for five days in succession
and dug out ten. On each side they dug out five.
</p>
<p>He wore ornaments of twisted copper wire coiled round his legs.
</p>
<p>The chief’s son gave five whales to the town people. Next day they cut them up. But
he left five. They were all fastened to his house with ropes. The sea-gulls eating
the whale meat lying around looked like smoke.
</p>
<p>Then he took his bow and arrows, and after he had looked at them for a while, he shot
a small sea-gull. He shot it through the head. Now he brought it in, split it open
at the tail, and skinned it. He dried the skin. When it was partly dried, he got into
it. He walked about on the floor-planks with it. Then he stretched his wings to fly.
He flew out. He left the town behind. His wives, too, did not have a trace of him.
</p>
<p>He flew up into Nass inlet, they say. Then he looked about for the place where his
father’s town was located. They were vainly trying to catch eulachon with fish-rakes.
In the canoe belonging to his father’s slaves was only one fish. Then he took it up
with his beak; one of them saw him and said: “Alas! he has carried off my eulachon.”
They looked up at him. They saw around his leg the thing that used to be around the
leg of the chief’s son whom they abandoned.
</p>
<p>Then they paddled off and landed bow first [in their haste].<a class="noteRef" id="n182.15src" href="#n182.15">15</a> The chief’s son whom they had abandoned had become a sea-gull. He had flown about
among them. This is what they said. Then his father and his mother turned around from
the fire, and, when they had stopped crying, he (the father) said to the slaves: “To-morrow
go to dig for the bones of my child.”
</p>
<p>Now the slaves went away, and, after they had gone down with the current for a while,
they found decayed pieces of whales floating about upon the water. When they had gone
on farther, they found two whales. After they had looked along a while for a place
to hide this, they left it there. In Nass inlet they were starving in the period before
the eulachon become thick. They left it until later.<a class="noteRef" id="n182.16src" href="#n182.16">16</a>
</p>
<p>They went away from it and came in sight of their master’s town. The town had become
larger. In front of the houses were crowds of people. They were boneless with astonishment.
Only the man in the stern paddled along.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p>He (the chief) came out. Lo! four of his father’s slaves were coming. Then he went
in and spanned his bow. He also took four arrows. He came out in a rough manner. He
was prepared to shoot at them, but the daughters of Ga′ogila and Master Carpenter
seized him by the shoulders. “Stop! let them land. Let them come into your house.
It is also well for you to let them go again.” Then his two wives took his bow from
him. He remained standing in the same place.
</p>
<p>When they landed he went down to them and said: “All four of you come ashore. After
you have taken off your clothing, come up with me.” So they stripped there and went
up with him. And he had them sit down at one side of the house and gave them food.
When the food was almost consumed he gave them some whale to eat. They ate it ravenously.
He had them strip because he was afraid they would take some [food] home.
</p>
<p>When they started off, one of them was so bent over as nearly to touch the ground.
Then he went over to him and asked him, “Say! why do you walk so bent over?” and he
replied, “Chief, I act that way because I am too full.” And when he (the head slave)
was ready to start, he gave him the following directions: “Say! do not touch the rotten
whale which is floating about. I shall watch it.” Then he said to them: “Say that
you could not find my bones.”
</p>
<p>Then they started off and landed in the night. And they said: “We could not find the
bones.” Then his parents wept. When they stopped, they went to sleep. [That night]
to their surprise the child of the head slave began to cry. He cried as people do
when things are lodged in their throats. Then the chief’s wife asked to have him handed
to her, and she held him on her knee. She put her finger into his mouth and found
something. Then they looked at it. They did not know what sort of thing it was.
</p>
<p>[The head slave] said: “I wish you could see what kind of house he lives in. What
used to be your town has become larger. His two wives brought out the town. They dug
it up, and they also dug out ten whales. Five are still floating there where they
were fastened.”
</p>
<p>Then, although it was midnight, the chief told them to put wood on the fire, and they
went out and called in the people. Immediately they came in. Then, after they had
consumed one salmon with the few last cranberries, [he said]: “I wish you to hear
what I think. I think you should go toward your son whom I left and to whom I will
give this town.” And all the town chiefs thought it good.
</p>
<p>Then his ten uncles planned like this: they would offer their daughters to him in
marriage. Their fathers were going to make marriage-gifts to them. Next day the town
was broken up. Hu, hu, hu, hu, hu! the canoes that they launched were large. They
painted up his uncles’ daughters. They paddled the canoes along together with planks
laid across the tops of them, on top of which they had their daughters sit.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>After they had gone along with the tide for a while they came to where the decayed
whale-meat was floating. They landed, steamed some, and ate it. Then they gave some
to their daughters, who sat in the canoes. But the daughter of the youngest uncle
had not had her face painted. Because she was [considered] good for nothing, he left
her so. Then he gave her a small piece of the inner layer of the bark of the hemlock.
He told her to chew part, and she did.
</p>
<p>Then they went on and came in sight of the town. It was most wonderful to behold.
The whales floated about it. But as soon as the chief discovered them he got his bow.
Then his two wives spoke to him, and he stopped.
</p>
<p>They stopped in front of him, and a good looking woman went shoreward first. He told
her to open her mouth. Her mouth smelt strong and he refused to have her. He refused
all nine in the same way. Now the youngest got off. She opened her mouth. It smelt
clean, and he smiled, and let her come in with him.
</p>
<p>When they landed [his father] gave the town people to his son, and they made their
homes on each side of those who were already there. Now he gave five whales to those
who had just come in. The next day they went down and cut them up. They ate these
ravenously.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>After some time had passed one started out from the town to hunt with dogs. After
he had been hunting for some time his dog barked at something. Then he went near it,
and lo! his dog was barking at a grizzly bear.
</p>
<p>Then he went to him. He threw him into his den. His wife sat at home. He was thrown
against her breast. Then she dug up the earth for him, and put him in the hole, leaving
only his cape outside.
</p>
<p>Now he (her husband) came in and asked her: “Where is the human being I threw in to
you?” “Here is the only thing you threw in to me, which I tore in pieces.” Then he
again went after him and could not find him. And again he asked her, but she [said
she] did not know.
</p>
<p>Now, at daybreak, he went hunting. He carried a big basket, and his wife let out his
thread of life.<a class="noteRef" id="n184.17src" href="#n184.17">17</a> It ran out irregularly. Then she let him (the man) out and gave him something to
eat, and they lay down together. When it began to jerk again, she pulled up a plank,
put him under, and sat on top.
</p>
<p>He entered. There were a few crabs in the bottom of the basket. He used to fill it,
but now it was different. He came in and sat down, but he did not know why he came
home empty.<a class="noteRef" id="n184.18src" href="#n184.18">18</a> Next day she again fastened the thread upon him, and he started off. But, while it
was unrolling, she cut it. Then she let the man out and married him. And she showed
him the trail upon which her husband used to hunt, explaining everything.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>Next day he took the basket and went inland. After he had gone up for a while, he
came upon a lake in an open space. In the middle of this was a shoal. Now he swam
over to it and put crabs into the basket. When his basket was full he went away. His
wife was very glad to see him, because his basket was full. He lived with her a while.
All that time he continued hunting in the same way.
</p>
<p>By and by she became pregnant. She gave birth to a boy. She became pregnant again
and bore another boy. She had two. Now he worked harder. By and by he stopped getting
crabs and hunted hair seal.
</p>
<p>One time he gathered them for four nights so that there were many and prepared to
go away. Then she gave him the following directions: “When you hunt, leave some for
my children. I will sit waiting at the upper end of the inlet.” And she said to him:
“Do not talk with another woman.” She gave him a small water-tight basket in which
was some water. A hawk feather also floated in it. Then she said to him: “Do not trifle
with other women. In this I shall see it. When you have finished eating, drink from
it.” So she directed him.<a class="noteRef" id="n185.19src" href="#n185.19">19</a>
</p>
<p>Then he went away from her and came to his father’s town. And, after he had sat near
a water hole behind it for a while, his mother came thither. Then he told her who
he was. His mother went home crying. Then his father spread out a Gī′na-g̣ā′da-skin<a class="noteRef" id="n185.20src" href="#n185.20">20</a> he owned for him, and he walked [into the house] upon it.
</p>
<p>Then they made a bed for him and he lay down there. They kept trying to get him to
eat something. He did not eat. By and by two went with him, and he hunted. He speared
hair seal. When the canoe was full he started for the inlet. Instead of objecting,
those with him looked on in silence.
</p>
<p>When he came to the end of the inlet there sat a grizzly bear. Then those who were
with him turned their backs to the bear (paddling in the opposite direction), but,
after he had paddled for a while facing her, he got off. Then he went to the grizzly
bear and sat down near her. The two young grizzly bears were glad to see him. They
licked him.
</p>
<p>He went down to the canoe and threw off a hair seal. Then he went away. And after
many nights had passed he went hunting again. The same ones were with him who had
been with him before. And he speared hair seal. When the canoe was full they made
a camp fire, and he steamed the hair seal there. Then they put it into the canoe and
went into the inlet again. When they had almost come to land those with him again
paddled in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>Again he got off and sat near the grizzly bear. The young ones licked him. Their mother,
however, did not look toward him. After he had sat near her for a while, he stood
up, threw off a hair seal, and went off by canoe.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span></p>
<p>But one time he went for water for himself. At that time he went with the one he used
to be in love with. Then he went home.
</p>
<p>After some space of time had passed he went hunting again, cooked some hair seal,
and went into the inlet. Now, differently from the way she used to act, the hair on
the back of her neck stood straight up. Then his companions said to him: “Let us go
back. The hair on the back part of her neck stands up, differently from the way in
which it used to be.” Still he paddled on. He landed and sat near her. She did not
look toward him. His children, however, were glad to see him.
</p>
<p>After he had sat there a while, she went to him and threw him about. As she did so
she tore his limbs off. Then the cubs quickly went at their mother and tore her to
pieces. Then they felt sorry on account of their mother. They acted as dogs do when
one puts medicine into their noses. Then they went away.
</p>
<p>Now, just as some people were starting a camp fire, [the cubs] came and killed them.
They went away again, and they killed some others. And, while they were continuing
to do this and were traveling about, they came and sat behind some people who had
lighted a fire, and a woman’s child cried. Then she said to it: “Do not cry. Your
uncle’s children might come and destroy us.” Upon hearing those things they went away.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>This island was once all covered with grass, they say. Woodpecker was traveling about
upon it. He had no feathers. And in the middle of the islands stood a large tree without
bark, on which he began hammering. Now, after he had done this for a while, something
said to him: “Your powerful grandfather says he wants you to come in.” He looked in
the direction of the sound. There was nothing to be seen.
</p>
<p>And when something said the same thing to him again, he looked into a hole at the
foot of the tree and [saw] an old man sitting far back, white as a sea gull. Then
he entered.
</p>
<p>The old man looked into his small box. After he had pulled one box from another four
times he took out a wing-feather. Wā-ā-ā-ā.<a class="noteRef" id="n186.21src" href="#n186.21">21</a> And he also stuck his tail into him and dressed him up. He made him red above, and
he said to him: “Now, grandson, go out and start life anew. This is what you came
in to me for.” Then he went out and flew. And, as he was going to do in the future,
he took hold of the tree with his claws and hammered on it.<a class="noteRef" id="n186.22src" href="#n186.22">22</a>
</p>
<p class="small">[Another version of the third section of this story, told to Professor Boas to explain
the carvings on the pole of “Nasʟᴇʟzu′s’s house” in Masset.]
</p>
<p>There was a man of the Eagle clan, a great hunter. For a whole year he was unsuccessful.
His name was Gāts.<a class="noteRef" id="n186.23src" href="#n186.23">23</a> He had two dogs. One day he saw a bear. He took his bow to shoot it. Then the bear
turned back and took hold of the man and carried him to his den. <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>After they reached there he gave the man to his wife, who hid him between her legs.
</p>
<p>The bear went hunting again. When he returned he asked his wife, “What became of the
man whom I caught?” She replied, “I think you did not bring a man; you only brought
his belt. Here it is.”
</p>
<p>Every time when the he-bear went hunting she took the man out of his hiding place,
and he became her lover. The two dogs had returned to the village. The people followed
them, discovered the bear, and killed him. Then the she-bear married the man. They
had a child.
</p>
<p>One day Gāts recalled his friends, and he asked his wife to let him return to his
own village. She agreed and said: “I am going hunting all the time, I will go and
give food to my child.” Then Gāts returned to his own village, where he had left a
wife. But before he returned the bear told him not to look at his former wife, else
she would kill him.
</p>
<p>One day the man went hunting with his two sons. On the hills he met the bear. He went
to meet her, and gave her some food. The people were afraid to accompany him on his
visit to the bear. When she saw him approaching she raised her ears and was glad to
see him.
</p>
<p>One day he went to a pond to fetch some water. While doing so he met his former wife
and smiled at her. Then he went hunting and caught many seals. In the evening he went
up the hill to meet the she-bear. Then her ears were turned forward like those of
an angry bear. She jumped into the water before the man had reached the shore, attacked
him, and killed him and his two sons.
</p>
<p class="small">Like the preceding, this story is compound, there being in reality three distinct
tales. The first and longest is that to which the title properly belongs, and the
main theme, the story of the person abandoned to die who was supernaturally helped
and became a great chief. It is popular from Yakutat bay to the Columbia river. The
second part, the story of the man who married a grizzly bear, was appended because
the hero is said to have belonged to the same town as the principal character in the
first part. It is a favorite Tsimshian story, and is referred to for the origin of
the secret societies. Another version, obtained by Professor Boas from Charlie Edenshaw,
chief of the Stᴀ′stas, is appended. The concluding section, telling how the woodpecker
obtained its brilliant plumage, seems to be altogether out of place here, but my informant
asserted that it was always told in this connection at Skedans. It is the only part
of the story manifestly Haida.

<p class="first center">[Told by John Sky of Those-born-at-Skedans]
</p>
<p>In Sealion-town<a class="noteRef" id="n190.1src" href="#n190.1">1</a> one began to bathe for supernatural power. All sorts of weak things came through
him [making him worthless]. He stayed with his eight younger brothers and his mother.
</p>
<p>By and by his younger brothers disappeared. It was not known whither they had gone.
Morning came and his mother wept. Again when day broke she wept. One day, when she
stopped crying, she said: “My eldest boy is as if he did not exist. When morning comes
my mind is always the same” (i.e., without gladness).
</p>
<p>After she had said this to him for some time he got tired of hearing it and said to
his sister: “Sister, pour salt water into the box my mother owns so that I may bathe
in it.” Then she put on her belt. She laid her mother’s stone box down near the door
and poured water into it.
</p>
<p>Then her brother crept over to it and just managed to crawl into it. After he had
stayed in it for a while he could not keep his buttocks under water. Then his sister
pressed down on his back with the poker which lay near the fire. After she had pressed
down upon him for a while she took away the stick. There was a small depth of water
over his back. Now she pressed him down again, and, when she removed it from him,
his back was well under the water. Then he broke the sides of the box by stretching.
</p>
<p>And again he called to his sister: “Sister, pour some water into another of your mother’s
boxes.” Then she again poured some into one. He got into it and stretched his knees
out in it. He broke that, too, at the joints.
</p>
<p>And again he called to his sister: “Sister, pour some water into another.” Then he
broke that also at the joints. He did the same thing to another one. He broke four
with his knees.
</p>
<p>Then he went into the sea. After he had remained there for a while something just
touched him. He reached for it. He seized the tail of a flounder. Now he called to
his sister: “Sister, roast and eat this.”
</p>
<p>And after he had been in the water a while longer something again touched him. He
reached for it. He seized half a halibut and threw it over to his sister. Then he
said to his sister: “Roast that. Do not steam it.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>He seized a porpoise tail and a white porpoise<a class="noteRef" id="n191.2src" href="#n191.2">2</a> tail. After he had taken all kinds of sea animals he also threw up a whale’s tail.
And he said to his sister: “Steam that one however.”
</p>
<p>After he had been in the water a while longer something touched him. He reached for
it. He felt nothing. And, when the same thing happened again, he grasped farther away.
Then his hand nearly slipped off from [the something], and he seized it in both hands.
When the something had pulled him out of Skidegate inlet he tried to stop at Łg̣a′-ixa,<a class="noteRef" id="n191.3src" href="#n191.3">3</a> but then something cracked at the bottom of the island. He held something nice which
was almost transparent, and put it around his head. That was Łg̣o′tg̣o-g̣ao<a class="noteRef" id="n191.4src" href="#n191.4">4</a> (the hair of him who tries the supernatural powers of men).
</p>
<p>After he had put it around his head he swam up the inlet. He swam in front of Gū′łga<a class="noteRef" id="n191.5src" href="#n191.5">5</a> and passed over to Xā′na.<a class="noteRef" id="n191.6src" href="#n191.6">6</a> The water was shallow and broad like a lake, and he traced a channel in it with his
hand and remained at its mouth.
</p>
<p>After he had remained in the water for a while something came walking toward him,
making a booming sound as it advanced. Some one stood on the shore opposite him. On
the right side he held a knot and a branch of g̣ōdañxō′sgî.<a class="noteRef" id="n191.7src" href="#n191.7">7</a> On the other side he carried a piece of common seaweed and some kwē′aogia′g̣adañ.<a class="noteRef" id="n191.8src" href="#n191.8">8</a>
</p>
<p>“Come hither, grandson.” At once he went to him. Then he said to him: “Now, grandson,
turn your breast (or ‘face’) to me.” Immediately he turned his breast to him. He struck
him with the knot. It was as when something is rubbed into fine pieces. And he struck
him with the <span class="corr" id="xd32e23647" title="Source: g̣ōdᴀñxō′sgî">g̣ōdañxō′sgî</span>. It became like the other. Then he said to him: “Now, grandson, turn your back to
me.” And so he did. He struck him with the kwē′aogia′g̣adañ. He did not feel it. Then
he struck him with the seaweed. He nearly knocked him over. Far off he recovered his
balance.
</p>
<p>“Wait a while, grandson. We will wrestle with (lit., “feel”) each other,” he said
to him. “Now, grandson, let us try each other.” And they laid hold of each other.
After he (the man) had shoved him about he almost threw him down. Then he turned away
smiling. “Grandson, yours has more strength. Swim down the inlet.”
</p>
<p>He went along; he went along and presently swam ashore at Sealion-town. Then he dried
himself by the fire and went to bed. After he had been in bed for a while, and day
had begun to break, he went out.
</p>
<p>Then he followed an indistinct trail. After he had gone along for a while, he saw
a shrew<a class="noteRef" id="n191.9src" href="#n191.9">9</a> trying vainly to cross an old log. Then he put her across and kept his eyes upon
her. She entered a bunch of ferns lying some distance away.
</p>
<p>Now he went to it. He moved it aside with his hand. To his astonishment there was
a painted house front there with the planks <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>sewed together. And she said to him, “Come in to me, grandson. News has come that
you want to borrow something of me.”
</p>
<p>Then she hunted in her box. She bit off part of something for him. “Now, my son, here
it is.” And she said to him: “When you get home and go up to Gū′łga lake, take along
your bow. There you will shoot a mallard. Blow up its stomach and put its grease into
it. I know that what destroyed your younger brothers lives there. You are going to
restore your younger brothers. Eat some [of the grease].”
</p>
<p>He went home and entered the house. After he had remained seated there for a while,
he went to bed. And next day early in the morning he went up to Gū′łga lake.<a class="noteRef" id="n192.10src" href="#n192.10">10</a> Male and female mallards<a class="noteRef" id="n192.11src" href="#n192.11">11</a> were there. They were pretty. He prepared his bow and shot just over the head of
one of them. It fell as when something is dropped. Then he got it ashore, made a fire
for it, plucked and steamed it. He saved its entrails.
</p>
<p>Then he went down upon the beach and picked up a big clam shell. Then he steamed the
duck and put the duck grease into the clam shell. He took out the duck meat to eat.
Then he put a [hot] stone into the duck grease. At that time the duck grease boiled
over. All the things that live in the forest said: “Be careful! the duck grease might
spill.” Thus they made him ashamed. He did not eat the duck meat. When the duck grease
settled down, he put it into the entrails.
</p>
<p>This is why, when the earth quakes, the Raven people tell [him] to be careful of the
duck grease. They say so because Sacred-one-standing-and-moving was a Raven.
</p>
<p>Then he went away. He saved the feathers and the duck grease. And he came home. Then
he went to bed.
</p>
<p>When next morning tore itself, he went to Gū′łga, took two children thence, and went
into the woods at the end of Sealion-town. When he came to the lake, he looked about,
pulled up two cedars entire, fastened them at the butt end with twisted cedar limbs,
did the same at the top, and held the two trunks apart by means of a stick. He laid
it in the lake, bound the legs of the two children, and placed them between.<a class="noteRef" id="n192.12src" href="#n192.12">12</a>
</p>
<p>When they moved, a wā′sg̣o<a class="noteRef" id="n192.13src" href="#n192.13">13</a> came out on the surface in the space between. Then he knocked out the stick and his
head was caught, but he pulled [his trap] under. The cedar came to the surface broken
as when something is thrown upward.
</p>
<p>Then he went home and stood up the dead children with the pole in front of the house.
He kept them for the next day. And again he went thither and took the two children.
After he had looked around for a while, he pulled out a large two-headed cedar, stump
and all. After he had split it, a wren jumped around him chirping: “Tcꜝê tcꜝê, my
sinews.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he went to get it, pulled out its sinews, spliced them together, and fastened
the butt end and the top with them. And he put it all into the water. After the children
had been again suspended above it for a while, the wā′sg̣o came up and got them. Then
he knocked out the cross stick and he (the wā′sg̣o) carried it down. After he had
carried it down, he floated up dead with it. Then he went to him and pulled him out.
</p>
<p>He pulled him up on the shore and was going to cut him on the top of his head when
it thundered. It also lightened. And the same thing happened when he started upon
his back. But, when he started at the lower part of his back, nothing happened, and
he cut him open along the belly. His younger brothers’ bones burst out from it.
</p>
<p>Then he fitted together his younger brothers’ bones and spit the medicine Mouse-woman<a class="noteRef" id="n193.14src" href="#n193.14">14</a> had given him upon them. Immediately they got up. And then he said: “Sit down where
you used to.” They were glad to see each other.
</p>
<p>After they had been there for a long time one disappeared. The next day another disappeared.
All eight of them disappeared in the same manner, and he felt sad.
</p>
<p>Then he went to Gū′łga, passed along to the point on the side toward the upper end
of the inlet, and to his surprise heard the buzzing of distant conversation on the
other side. Then he pulled off the ribbon with which he used to tie his hair and threw
[one end of] it across. Upon this he walked over and [found] a crowd of spectators
at the door of the middle house, in which people were talking. Then he passed through
them and looked in.
</p>
<p>In the rear of the house a certain thing hung, under which one lay face up. Out of
it flames played at intervals. It was sizzling there. While he looked on the person
was driven out by the fire. The supernatural beings filled the whole space in the
rear of the house.
</p>
<p>After he had sat there for a while, one stood up. He said: “Get Stone-ribs, and settle
him under it (the earth) forever.” He heard what they said. By and by one went out.
After a while he came back, and they asked him: “Is he coming?” And he said: “He is
near.”
</p>
<p>Presently he came in. Like a son of one of the supernatural beings, he wore a copper
coat. He also had on a marten-skin coat. And as soon as he had entered he lay under
[the fire]. It was burning upon his breast. Out from it sparks went.
</p>
<p>A certain one stood near the door and another on the other side. In the rear of the
house sat his mother, Djila′qons. The one standing on the side toward the door said:
“They are talking about it. They are talking about it.”<a class="noteRef" id="n193.15src" href="#n193.15">15</a> The one on the opposite side also said: “The supernatural beings who talk about the
places which they are going to inhabit in the future also talk about this.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>She called for one of the servants who sat among them. “One-who-moves-heaven-by-the-rapidity-of-his-motion,
go and call Swimming-russet-backed-thrush. I want to ask whether I went with him.”
He said that he went with the chieftainess. She asked to have him called so that she
might cross-question him about it.
</p>
<p>There was no one to have his seat under this island. Then one day passed for Stone-ribs.
Another day was about to pass for him. The supernatural beings acted as if shivering.
They were afraid. They feared that he, belonging to the wrong side, was going to settle
beneath them.<a class="noteRef" id="n194.16src" href="#n194.16">16</a>
</p>
<p>Again those standing near the door spoke. They spoke as they had done before. And
One-who-moves-heaven-by-the-rapidity-of-his-motion went to call Swimming-russet-backed-thrush.
By and by he came back. Then she asked him if he were coming, and he said: “He is
coming.” “Perhaps I went with him at Goose creek, where I dug out wild-clover roots,
or perhaps I went with him at Łg̣ē′djîs.” At that instant he came in. He was good-looking.
He had been gambling. He held his hand to his face with fine cedar bark in it. He
wiped part of his face clean. As soon as he went over to the chief woman he pushed
himself into her blanket. She was looking at him. She looked longer than was necessary.<a class="noteRef" id="n194.17src" href="#n194.17">17</a>
</p>
<p>Another day dawned for Stone-ribs. It was broad daylight for him, and the supernatural
beings were as if shivering with fear at the prospect of having him settle down beneath
them. Just before daylight he was driven out by the burning.
</p>
<p>Now, after they had thought for a while, one stood up, saying: “Let them send for
Sacred-one-standing-and-moving. They say that he bathed in the ocean so much in order
to settle down under it.”
</p>
<p>Then he went out of the house, threw his ribbon across again, and ran over upon it.
And he said to his mother: “They are setting out to get me. You will go with me. She-upon-whose-feet-property-makes-a-noise
will also go with me.” As soon as he had finished saying this, they came for him.
And he said he would come by canoe by himself.
</p>
<p>Then he went to get his wā′sg̣o skin, which he kept between the two heads of a cedar,
and he put it on while he was still in the house. He walked about, too pretty to be
looked at by anyone. Then they started across. His mother steered, and his sister
was in the bow. He stood in the middle as they went. And his sister got off, then
his mother, last himself.
</p>
<p>They went up. His sister went ahead. She held the [duck] entrails in her hands. His
mother had the feathers inside of her blanket. When he entered, the supernatural beings
held their heads down to him. He looked grand. He entered wearing the wā′sg̣o skin.
</p>
<p>And as soon as he entered he lay down underneath. He was sizzling from the fire. Again
it burned at intervals. When it stopped <span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>burning, his sister greased [his skin] with the duck grease. His mother put feathers
upon it.
</p>
<p>By and by one night was counted for him. Then the supernatural beings fastened their
eyes upon him. Lo, another night was about to be counted for him. At this time the
supernatural beings talked about the places where they were going to settle. They
divided themselves up. At that time one among them stood up. He said: “Where is the
sister of the supernatural beings, Woman-people-want-to-have, going to have her place?”
“I do not know. I do not know. I shall have my place with my children a little way
behind the chiefs among the trees.”<a class="noteRef" id="n195.18src" href="#n195.18">18</a>
</p>
<p>By and by, when day began to break, they were looking on. Presently the Raven called.
It was daylight. But then they discovered him enter and lie down under it.<a class="noteRef" id="n195.19src" href="#n195.19">19</a> Then he came to have his place under it (the island).
</p>
<p>Then they went for Fast-rainbow-trout<a class="noteRef" id="n195.20src" href="#n195.20">20</a> and Marten. And they put a string on him (Fast-rainbow-trout) and sent him up with
it. Then it was not long enough. He spliced hemlock roots to it. Marten went down
with the lower end.<a class="noteRef" id="n195.21src" href="#n195.21">21</a>
</p>
<p>Now the supernatural beings separated, leaving the town of X̣ᴀ′i­na<a class="noteRef" id="n195.22src" href="#n195.22">22</a> for the various places they had already talked about settling in.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Now Stone-ribs traveled about upon this island. After he had traveled for some time
he entered the house and said to his mother: “Mother, toward Cape G̣ᴀ′ñxet<a class="noteRef" id="n195.23src" href="#n195.23">23</a> some one calls for me, weeping.” And next day he went about upon this island hunting
birds. He went about upon it as one does upon something small.
</p>
<p>And again he said to his mother: “Mother, she calls, wailing for me as if she would
never cease.” Then he said to her: “I will go and help her.” And she said to her son:
“Don’t, chief, don’t; they might call you skᴀ′mdal.”<a class="noteRef" id="n195.24src" href="#n195.24">24</a> “That is all right, mother; I am going to help her.”<a class="noteRef" id="n195.25src" href="#n195.25">25</a>
</p>
<p>Then, very early next day, he started off again, passed Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o,<a class="noteRef" id="n195.26src" href="#n195.26">26</a> went around Skedans point, and came to Broken-shells-of-the-supernatural-beings.
At that time he took quicker steps. Then he ran over to Village-that-stretches-itself-out.
And he went along down the inlet. Then he came near some white shells. Seaward, to
his surprise, an eagle was trying to catch something and almost succeeded several
times.
</p>
<p>Then he looked at it. Again it almost caught it in its flight. And after he had thought
about it he went down to it. And, when he got there, a halibut was swimming about
in the standing water. There were stripes of copper along its edges. Out of its nose
hung a weasel. Now he caught the halibut in his hands. He was very glad to have it.
And when he was going to split it around the edges with his finger nails it thundered;
and when he was about to do the same thing along <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>the under side it again thundered; and when he was about to split it along its upper
surface it again thundered and lightning shot about. Then he [split] it along its
tail; and when he had finished skinning it he put it on.
</p>
<p>Then he went into the pond before him. Bullheads shot away from him. When he opened
his mouth, lo! the bullheads all went into it. And he opened his mouth. From his mouth
they came strongly and quickly. They floated about dead. He got out of it and put
it in his armpit.
</p>
<p>He had two coats. He had a copper coat and he had a marten-skin coat. Before he started
off, he practiced before his mother with them on, and, when he nearly burst his mother’s
house by swelling up, she cried to him to stop.
</p>
<p>He started and came to Łg̣adᴀ′n village.<a class="noteRef" id="n196.27src" href="#n196.27">27</a> Then he skinned the woman’s child, and lo! he was born instead. He grew up as rapidly
as a dog. Immediately he began to walk. One day, as soon as he came in from out of
doors, he wept so hard that they could not stop him. She tried to stop him in every
way. He would not be satisfied.
</p>
<p>After he had cried for a while, he said: “Ha, bow-shaped object; ha, bow-shaped object.”
At that time she tried to stop him all the harder. As he wept he made the motion of
handling a bow. By and by his mother pounded up some copper ornament she wore and
she also finished arrows for him.
</p>
<p>He was hunting birds. He did not sleep. And, one day when it was fine weather, they
went for shellfish. They did not take his mother with them. Then, after it had been
stormy for a while, it was again calm, and they went for shellfish.
</p>
<p>Then he asked his mother if she owned a canoe. And, when his mother said that she
did own one, he went along with them and his mother to get shellfish. While they were
still going along the leading canoes had already landed. He landed his mother among
the canoes which were floating about and remained floating back of them.
</p>
<p>Now, when the baskets of those who had gone first were full, he lay down in his canoe,
and, using the canoe as a drum, beat upon it with his bow. Then they made motions
toward his face from the shore. They spoke in low voices. And they loaded their canoes
and went off in terror. Before they had reached the village he told his mother to
hurry up. Then she put the mussels in the bow. His mother seated him at the very stern,
and they went landward from Qꜝā′g̣awa-i.
</p>
<p>As they went along in fright, he (Qꜝā′g̣awa-i)<a class="noteRef" id="n196.28src" href="#n196.28">28</a> came after them. And, when he came near, he opened his mouth for them. But, as he
was carrying them into his mouth in a current, [the boy] took his bow, pushed his
lips together, and shoved him back, and he went under the water. They went on.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they came to her, his mother said she was saved by blowing through her labret
hole and putting her feet into the water. He listened.
</p>
<p>After they had lived there for a while, it became stormy weather again. It was bad
weather. When the mussels became spoiled for food, it was again calm, and they again
went out after mussels. Some time after, he and his mother went out. After the baskets
of those ahead had been filled, he struck upon the edges of the canoe. And again they
opened and closed their hands to him for him to stop. After he had watched them for
a while, they went away in fright, and he too went after them.
</p>
<p>After they had gone on for a while, [Qꜝā′g̣awa-i] again pursued. He had five fins.
Again, as soon as the current flowed into his mouth, they floated inward. Then he
(the boy) closed his lips with his hands and shoved him back.
</p>
<p>And, when they landed, they came down to meet her. They asked whether he came to the
surface, and she said that she blew through her labret and put her foot into the sea.
That was how she was saved, she said.
</p>
<p>And again it was bad weather. After bad weather had lasted for some time, he went
to a point toward the end of the town, entered his halibut skin, and went into the
water. Presently he came to a broad trail, and, having traveled upon it for a while,
arrived at the town of Qꜝā′g̣awa-i.
</p>
<p>After he had peered into the houses, he looked into his (Qꜝā′g̣awa-i’s). In the rear
of the house between the screens, which pointed toward each other, sat his daughter.
He fell in love with her, so that he shook with desire.
</p>
<p>Then, after he had gone around the town for a while, evening came, and he entered
his house. He sat down in the rear of his house. His skin clothing had five fins upon
it. He looked at it. Then they went to bed. And, as soon as he went to her, they lay
together.
</p>
<p>Then day broke and the town people went fishing. After the sounds had lasted for some
time, he rose. To his surprise they were fishing right in front of the town. Then
he went into his halibut skin. And, after he had swum around the edges of the canoes
for a while, he opened his mouth for them and closed it quickly. They went quickly
into his mouth. And, after he had kept his lips closed around them for a while, he
opened his mouth.
</p>
<p>Now he went up and went toward the place he started from. Then he went in. After he
had sat there for a while, it was again evening, and he again went to meet the woman.
He was very fond of her. He went to her and came back often. And as he lay with [Qꜝā′g̣awa-i’s]
daughter, he listened to them talking about himself and nothing else.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they were out fishing, he entered his skin. He opened his mouth for two [canoes]
and spit them out shoreward.
</p>
<p>And again he went away, and, after he had sat in the house for a while, evening came,
and he went down to her. And he lay with [the chief’s] daughter.
</p>
<p>He (the chief) was preparing to go out fishing with the others. They brought out his
skin clothing, and they brought out his war spear and his arrow box. They put pitch
on the points of these [arrows] in case he (Stone-ribs) had too much power for him.
And he heard him say he was going to break his head with his teeth.
</p>
<p>Presently day came, and he heard the sound they made as they went out fishing. When
it stopped, he arose, swam off again, and came out on the surface near two canoes
at one end. Then one waved a paddle. They did this for Qꜝā′g̣awa-i. He had not let
out fishing lines. Instead his canoe floated quietly among them.
</p>
<p>He went thither, and those who were there pointed into the water with their paddles.
“It is lying right there,” they said to him. Then he seized his spear. He looked at
it. It was too small, however, and he picked up an arrow instead. Then he speared
it. He struck it in the side and pulled it up. Then he said: “Is this the thing that
destroyed you?” and they said to him: “Do not speak like that. That is it.”
</p>
<p>Now he told them to begin fishing, and they pulled halibut in and clubbed them. He
was lying in the canoe. The skin of the Qꜝā′g̣awa-i had already been lying there for
some time. After he had swelled up so as to fill this, they found it out. Then [Qꜝā′g̣awa-i]
took his spear and speared him. Instead of being harmed he stretched it more and the
canoe became covered with water. Immediately the salt water boiled. He captured his
skin. He opened his mouth for them. As many as were fishing came fast into his mouth,
but for some purpose he let two persons go home. Then he came away with the rest.
He let them out toward the shore at a bay at one end of the town. From the very shore
they fell over landward like a pile of wood. They lay near the shore without skins.
Fins were on them.<a class="noteRef" id="n198.29src" href="#n198.29">29</a> Then he went in to his mother.
</p>
<p>Next day he said to his mother: “Mother, I intend to go away from you. I am not really
your son. I came and helped you because you called for me as you wept. My mother’s
place is in the middle of this island.”
</p>
<p>At once his mother sang crying songs. And on account of her crying he thought he would
stay a day more, and he stayed near her one night, but next day he went away.
</p>
<p>As soon as he went out he put on his copper coat. Over this he put his marten-skin
coat. Over both he put his Qꜝā′g̣awa-i skin and started around the west coast wearing
them. The supernatural <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>beings living there opened their doors for him. After he had traveled about for some
time [he came to] one living in the middle of the island whose door was shut, and,
as he passed by, reaching out sidewise he took hold of him, and his house fell flat
toward the sea.
</p>
<p>And after he had traveled on he came to one fishing for black cod. When he came opposite
to him he said to him: “Now, great chief, Stone-ribs, that you are, going along carefully,
let me have the head. For that I am waiting here.”<a class="noteRef" id="n199.30src" href="#n199.30">30</a>
</p>
<p>Then he turned back toward him. He pushed his arm into a rocky cave there, moved his
arm about to make it larger, and gathered black cod together in his arms. When there
were many in his arms he threw them into the cave. And he pushed him into the cave
afterward. He (the man put into the cave) strung the fishing line with them, put some
also into his canoe, and went away. He towed the string of black cod behind him.
</p>
<p>Thence he wandered on for a while and entered Tcꜝā′ał inlet.<a class="noteRef" id="n199.31src" href="#n199.31">31</a> Where the inlet almost closes together, lo! something lay face up waiting for him.
Its arms were half copper. It lay in wait for him. Then he lay still in front of it
for a while and looked at it. It had five fins.
</p>
<p>By and by, however, he let himself go on over its belly, and it seized him. Even his
insides it squeezed. Its claws even went through his copper coat. He tried to swell
up. In vain. Then he entered the halibut skin and escaped between its claws. It got
its skin back because it belonged to the same clan [as Qꜝā′g̣awa-i].
</p>
<p>Then he passed through the strait. When he came to Spit-point he (the point) let himself
dry up on account of him. Then he remained still for a while. After he had stood still
for a time he jumped up and flopped his way across it. After he had done so he entered
the water on the other side. That is the Qꜝoas.<a class="noteRef" id="n199.32src" href="#n199.32">32</a>
</p>
<p>After he had traveled on a while he came to where Rock-point’s house stood. Swim-far-off<a class="noteRef" id="n199.33src" href="#n199.33">33</a> placed himself half out of the door. He was afraid at the sight of his spines. He
was looking at him, and he said to him: “Go around far from me, chief. I shall kill
you.” On account of what he said he went around close to the island on the other side
from him.
</p>
<p>After he had traveled farther [he came to where] two persons were fishing from a canoe
at the Cumshewa inlet fishing ground, in front of Ta′og̣ał bay. The bow man was making
guesses as follows: “I wonder whether he who they say has been traveling around the
west coast has passed this point.” Then the one in the stern said: “Horrors! what
terrible thing will happen for what you have said. Let us go home.” And he himself
cut the anchor line, and they went off in fright. Then he bit off half of their canoe
and pushed the man in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>stern along toward the shore. Near Ta′og̣ał he threw [the other] up from his mouth.
He was changed into a rock there.
</p>
<p>Then he went away. He stood up at Skedans bay, and inland, near the trees, he turned
his back to the sunshine. Lo! he felt sleepy and lost consciousness. While he was
in that condition [he heard] a noise like x̣ū. He looked toward it. Lo! he (an eagle)
had his skin in his claws. Then he put on his copper coat and went after it.
</p>
<p>The eagle flew inland and perched there. [A supernatural being] stood waiting for
him. He had a war spear. He had a war helmet. Then he (Stone-ribs) passed behind him
on the run. When he was at some distance he grasped him. His head was in his hand.
Then he threw it toward the head of the creek.<a class="noteRef" id="n200.34src" href="#n200.34">34</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>There lay the town of Skedans.<a class="noteRef" id="n200.35src" href="#n200.35">35</a> And the town chief there owned Sand-reef.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n200.35asrc" href="#n200.35">35</a> One day he went thither for hair seal and called the people in [to eat them]. They
kept taking them over by canoe. All that time they called in the people for them.
The town chief was named Upward.<a class="noteRef" id="n200.36src" href="#n200.36">36</a>
</p>
<p>One day he went thither. At the landward end of Gwai-djātc<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n200.35bsrc" href="#n200.35">35</a> in front of Qî′ñgiłu some people in a canoe sang something. They used the edges of
their canoe as a drum. He went to them. He [arrived] there, and lo! the song was about
him. The song they composed was: “Upward’s wife is always fooling with somebody.”<a class="noteRef" id="n200.37src" href="#n200.37">37</a>
</p>
<p>Then he pulled them in. He asked them why they clubbed seals on his reef. Hair seals
were in their canoe. Then he fastened them to two canoe seats. And he started homeward
with them. When they got even with Mallard-grease-in-hand on the north side of Island-that-wheels-around-with-the-current<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n200.35csrc" href="#n200.35">35</a> one said to his younger brother: “Younger brother, take him, take him.” Then both
seized him at once. They fastened him to the canoe. Then they took in his hair seal
and went back.
</p>
<p>Now they took him into their father’s house. Those that he pulled in were Farthest-one-out’s
sons.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n200.35dsrc" href="#n200.35">35</a> They laid him down in the middle of the side of their father’s house<a class="noteRef" id="n200.38src" href="#n200.38">38</a> and told their adventures to their father. And they said: “Father, he spoke to us
about what you gave to us as a chief’s children. He pulled us into his canoe. He fastened
us in the canoe.” And their father said: “My child, chief, my son, it is not as your
slave father has said, but as common surface birds shall say.”<a class="noteRef" id="n200.39src" href="#n200.39">39</a> He spoke like this, as if speaking to a slave.
</p>
<p>Then they brought him in. And they brought in a large, water-tight basket, put stones
into the fire, and, when they became red hot, put them into the water in the basket
with tongs. When it boiled, they put him in, canoe and all. Then they shook up the
basket with him in it, and, when it began to swell up, he held fast to the cross-seats.
Then they went to him. They laughed at him because he was afraid.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p>After they had laughed at him for a while, his wife sat down hard upon the top of
the house. She was crying aloud. At the same time she made holes in the top of the
house with her fingers. Water dropped into it. She asked what they were doing to her
husband. But just then he began to think of a copper drum he owned, [and it came to
him]. When he began drumming on it with the tips of his fingers, the chief said: “Take
him and throw him out, chiefs, my children.” Then they took him, and they threw him
out along with the canoe. Immediately she took her husband and went away with him.
</p>
<p>And, after he had stayed with his wife a while, he thought of the words that Farthest-one-out’s
sons put into [their songs] about him. Then he slept apart from his wife. After he
had done this for some time, he woke up one night. Lo! he heard his wife talking with
some one. But he did not disturb himself, and, when day broke, he sharpened a mussel
shell knife he owned. And, when they went to bed, he remained awake. The moon rose.
When it became light, the end of a rainbow came through the smoke-hole. He looked
at it. It extended to his wife’s [room]. Then the rainbow again drew itself out through
the smoke-hole.
</p>
<p>After some time had elapsed, he heard some one talking to his wife. When the talking
ceased, he crept over thither. He seized the man’s hair and cut his head off. Then
he went out and fastened his head over the door.
</p>
<p>After many nights had passed, a woman came by canoe and stopped in front of him. After
she had remained there for a while, she said: “Come, chief, throw down your nephew’s
head to me.” He paid no attention to her. It was <span class="corr" id="xd32e23928" title="Source: Djila′qons’s">Djila′qons’</span> son, who had been in love with his wife, whose head he had cut off.
</p>
<p>Again she said landward: “Come, chief, put your nephew’s head into my canoe.” He absolutely
refused. Then she became angry and almost struck the town with something that was
half red, half blue.<a class="noteRef" id="n201.40src" href="#n201.40">40</a> And the town of Skedans almost tipped over. Then he went out and pushed it back again
as he walked along.
</p>
<p>The woman said the same thing again, and again he refused her. When she almost struck
the town with her stick, it almost turned over again. And again he straightened it
with his feet. Then he took the head and threw it out. And the hair-seal canoe<a class="noteRef" id="n201.41src" href="#n201.41">41</a> in which she came started off of itself, while he stood still there and looked on.
</p>
<p>Then he went along upon Trail-inland<a class="noteRef" id="n201.42src" href="#n201.42">42</a> and entered the water at [point] Lying-seaward.<a class="noteRef" id="n201.43src" href="#n201.43">43</a> And he got his arms ready for her in the salt water. Her servants were doing the
paddling. When they got above him, he laid hold of [the canoe]. Then they paddled
backward. They were unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>Then the chief-woman said, “Come in, chief, if it is you. Things shall not be different
from the way you want them.” And lo! Upward <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>rolled in through the bailing-hole. At once he went to the middle where the chief-woman
sat. He stretched his arm across, and they lay there with each other.<a class="noteRef" id="n202.44src" href="#n202.44">44</a>
</p>
<p>When they got home, she put her son’s head in its place, and he was restored. After
he had had her as his wife for some time, and it was toward the end of autumn, the
chief-woman began digging roots with the servants. One day, after they had come home,
they appeared happy. He listened to them. He did not know why they acted that way.
He got firewood in readiness for their return from digging roots. They came home together,
and every time they were happy.
</p>
<p>By and by, when they started off again, he went behind them. As they went along in
a line, they beat upon thin boards held in their hands. They sang as they went. It
sounded nice and sharp. The chief woman went in advance. He observed them stealthily.
</p>
<p>Then they sat down at a certain point down the inlet, and sang there. The chief woman
sat near the water. This he saw. By and by something having thick eyebrows came flying
from above and sat near her. He was good looking. They lay with each other.
</p>
<p>Then he went home, and, when they came home, he said to his wife, “Say! to-morrow
you better not go. I will go. I will get a great quantity of roots of all kinds.”
And next day he borrowed her belt and dress, and had his hair parted while still in
the house. Now they sang as they walked. He went ahead of them.
</p>
<p>He went to the edge of the water. He rolled away a rock with his hands and picked
a sea-cucumber from the place where it had rested. Then he sat in the place where
the chief woman used to sit. Shoreward the servants were also singing. By and by the
person came flying down from above, sat near him, and lay down. And he cut off his
penis. He put the sea-cucumber in its place. He went up from him making a noise.
</p>
<p>Then he was happy, and he came home. He gave back the chief woman’s labret to her.
Next day very early the servants rose, and, after they had eaten, they went outside.
Just outside they sang the song. Again they went off in a crowd singing.
</p>
<p>Now he again went along behind them. After the chief woman had seated herself, he
came flying down again. They lay down. When the chief woman turned toward him, lo!
a sea cucumber had been put into him. Then she wept. The servants also wept.
</p>
<p>Then he went home and cut up firewood. And in the evening, when they came home, instead
of being happy, the servants had tear marks on their faces. Then he asked them, “Why
are you all sad? I guess you have become witches.” That was Snowy-owl with which the
chief woman lay. For that reason he used these words.
</p>
<p>After he had lived with his wife a while longer, some one said “The chief is coming.”
Immediately they sent Marten into the <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>woods. Then he pulled up a bunch of fern by the roots. He tied the stalks together
and sat down by the edge of the fire toward the door. Five Land-otter-women sat in
the corner of the house and one of them had Upward inside of her blanket.
</p>
<p>Presently [the strangers] came in and sat in a circle. Then Raven<a class="noteRef" id="n203.45src" href="#n203.45">45</a> called for one of the young boys who moved in a crowd on the side of the house toward
the door. And, after he had whispered into his ear, [the boy] went out.<a class="noteRef" id="n203.46src" href="#n203.46">46</a> And, after he had been away for a while, they spread out a mat in the middle of the
side of the house, and five persons with matted hair sat upon it. After they had sat
there for a while, one of them began acting as a shaman, and they sang a song for
him as he acted. After he had done this for a while, he pointed at the one who held
Upward hidden. When they all went to her, he (Marten) pushed the ferns on the fire.
Immediately it became dark, and he was handed to another. After they had pulled her
up straight, they found nothing at all upon her.
</p>
<p>Then another acted as shaman and pointed at the one who was hiding him. Then they
started for her. Again Marten shoved the ferns into the fire. While it was dark they
passed him to another one. She, too, they had stand up. There was nothing whatever
upon her.
</p>
<p>Again one acted as shaman. Again he pointed at one of them. There was not a sign of
a thing upon her. Still another acted as shaman. When he pointed at the one who held
him, they went for her. Then Upward changed himself into a cinder and hid himself
at the edge of the smoke-hole.
</p>
<p>Then the one who sat at the end of those who came by canoe with Raven acted as shaman.
And, after they had sung a song for him for a while, he pointed up at him, and they
went to get him. [He floated up] and after he had kept coming down for a while, lo!
they brought Upward in.
</p>
<p>Then they brought him before <span lang="hax">Wī′gît</span>, and he pulled his arm off. And, after he had pulled his other arm off, he gave them
to the one (shaman) who sat next to him. Now he pulled out both of his legs and gave
them to the shamans. And his body, too, he cut in pieces and gave to them. Then they
ate it. They consumed it all. And, after they had sat there for a while, they became
sick in the stomach. They died. Their bodies were pulled away and thrown outside.
</p>
<p class="center">[The story of Stone-ribs as told by Tom Price of Those-born-in-the-Ninstints-country]
</p>
<p>From the town of <span lang="hax">Łg̣adᴀ′n</span> they began to go out fishing for black cod. Then a creature having five fins at an
island lying seaward called <span lang="hax">Qꜝā′g̣awa-i</span> pursued them. And canoes were rapidly carried into his mouth by a current of water.
But still they feared that they were going to starve to death and went out fishing.
Many escaped. Mussels grew upon that island only. That is why they went to it. <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>And they would not touch their paddles to the edges of their canoes [for fear of making
a noise].
</p>
<p>When he had nearly destroyed them all, Djila′qons’ son said: “I will go to the south
country. I will kill <span lang="hax">Qꜝā′g̣awa-i</span>.” Then his mother said to him: “Do not do it, chief; they will say <span lang="hax">Łᴀ′ndal</span> to you.<span class="corr" id="xd32e24018" title="Not in source">”</span><a class="noteRef" id="n204.47src" href="#n204.47">47</a> After she had said so for some time, she told him he might go.
</p>
<p>And, after he had gone along for a while, [when he reached] point Skwai he became
tired of walking and lay with his back against a rock. Then a sound like the rushing
of wind came to his ears, and he looked in the direction of it. [An eagle] was almost
touching a salt water pool in front of him in its flight.
</p>
<p>Then he went thither, and, when he looked into the pool, [he saw] a small halibut
floating there. Now he took it out. And, when he tried to cut it open along the side,
all the supernatural beings protested. It also thundered. In whatever way he tried
it, he was unsuccessful until he cut it open from its tail when nothing happened.
Now he skinned it and dried the skin in the sunshine. He was glad to have it. And
he went away with it.
</p>
<p>By and by he came to the town of <span lang="hax">Łg̣adᴀ′n</span>. It was evening and he looked about among the houses. He looked for a place where
a child had just been born. By and by he saw a child lying in the cradle. When they
were asleep, he destroyed it. But he became born in its place. His [new] mother was
named <span lang="hax">Gwā′g̣anat</span>.
</p>
<p>And, after he had grown somewhat, he asked to have a copper bow and copper arrows
made for him. All the time he was growing up they went out fishing and he (<span lang="hax">Qꜝā′g̣awa-i</span>) swallowed them. And, when they came in from fishing, Supernatural-sparrow<a class="noteRef" id="n204.48src" href="#n204.48">48</a> living in front of the town ate all of their uncut halibut.
</p>
<p>Then he began to shoot birds. He shot robins, the feathers of which along with those
of the flicker were on his cradle. After he had become quite strong he killed geese
and wild swans. His mother asked him whence he got them, and he said: “I am [getting
them] from ʟdas.<span class="corr" id="xd32e24056" title="Not in source">”</span><a class="noteRef" id="n204.49src" href="#n204.49">49</a> After that he also killed the big sparrow that lived there.
</p>
<p>After he had shot birds for some time longer he said he had lost a black bird which
he attempted to kill. He was sad about it. The next time he went out he brought it
in skinned. That was the raven. Again he went out and flew around the island with
its skin on. He flew down from above. He shot it in the country he called ʟdas.
</p>
<p>After he was able to fly to some height he said: “I am going to kill <span lang="hax">Qꜝā′g̣awa-i</span>.” Then his uncle said to his mother: “Put charcoal on the lips of that boy who is
talking.” At once his mother did so to him. They were afraid to mention the name of
<span lang="hax">Qꜝā′g̣awa-i</span> near the fire. They were afraid that “Woman-under-the-fire” would take <span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>over to him the boy’s words. He sat around with charcoal upon his lips.<a class="noteRef" id="n205.50src" href="#n205.50">50</a>
</p>
<p>After that the town people went to <span lang="hax">Qꜝā′g̣awa-i</span> to get shell-fish, and his mother was with them. Then he cried after them. He was
faint from crying. Now he told them plainly that he was going to kill <span lang="hax">Qꜝā′g̣awa-i</span>. Then they took him with them. They fastened a weasel skin in his hair, and he took
his copper bow and arrows.
</p>
<p>After they had gathered mussels at the island for a while, they went off home from
him. In that place he sang songs, and he beat upon the edges of his canoe with his
bow, in lieu of a drum. They were unable to stop him. And when they went off from
him he again sang the song.
</p>
<p>At that time <span lang="hax">Qꜝā′g̣awa-i</span> came after them. Then the canoe went into its mouth. And he came to himself in its
belly, put on his halibut skin, and swelled up in its stomach. He killed it.
</p>
<p>All of its five fins had the figures of human beings at the base. At that time he
showed himself to be Stone-ribs. He told them that he was the son of Djila′qons. At
that time he told them the crests they would use.
</p>
<p>Then he traveled around the west coast, wearing the halibut skin. Now a big mountain
called “Looking-at-his-own-shadow” called him in. He entered his house, and he was
glad to meet him. After he had given him some dried food he gave him half of a whale
to eat. When he had finished eating and was about to go out Looking-at-his-own-shadow
laughed at him. Then he said: “Door, shut yourself.” And the stone hanging door fell.
Now there was no way for him to go out.
</p>
<p>Then, right in the house, he put on his halibut skin. And, after he had flopped around
for a while, he got his fins under the edges of the hanging door and threw it up with
his tail. When it fell back it broke. He shut all sorts of supernatural beings in,
and they were entirely unable to get out. Only he (Stone-ribs) did it.
</p>
<p>After that he entered the house of “Sunshine-on-his-breast.” He, however, treated
him well. After he had been given something to eat, he went out of his house.
</p>
<p>After that he entered Tcꜝī′da’s house.<a class="noteRef" id="n205.51src" href="#n205.51">51</a> He, too, was good to him. Then he had on the Qꜝā′g̣awa-i skin and let himself be
seen by the town people. That is why those born at Kaisun wear the Qꜝā′g̣awa-i as
a crest.
</p>
<p>When he started to leave that place, they told him that Greatest-crab lived in the
channel between the two islands. Still he went thither. Just as he had heard, it opened
its claws for him. And, when he passed over it, it cut through the fins along the
edges of his halibut skin with its teeth. Then Stone-ribs was sorry for this and went
back to it. He swallowed the crab.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span></p>
<p>After that he let himself be seen upon this island. The supernatural beings were glad
to see him because he saved the people from the thing that made the south end of the
island empty. Only two treated him differently.
</p>
<p>He went into Nastō′’s house,<a class="noteRef" id="n206.52src" href="#n206.52">52</a> also. After the latter had given him food, he let him go feeling happy. After that
he let out the crab in Naden harbor. That is why there are so many crabs there.
</p>
<p>After that Na-iku′n let himself dry up before him.<a class="noteRef" id="n206.53src" href="#n206.53">53</a> Then he entered his halibut skin and flopped his way across overland. That is the
inside passage used by canoes. And, after he had gone on farther, Spit-point also
dried itself up in front of him. Then he entered his halibut skin and passed it in
the same way. That is the place through which they pass by canoe.
</p>
<p>Then he entered the house of Many-ledges. After he, too, had given him something to
eat, he went on. [Many-ledges] was pleased to see him. Afterward Qî′ñgi<a class="noteRef" id="n206.54src" href="#n206.54">54</a> asked him to come in. The supernatural beings invited him in because they wanted
to see Qꜝā′g̣awa-i’s skin. All that time he let them see his skin.
</p>
<p>After that he went inland and sat down at point Skwai. After he had sat there for
some time something occurred like the quick passage of a strong wind. When he looked
toward it an eagle had his halibut skin. But when he said “Alas!” all the forest beings
told him not to go after it. “It was not yours. Your mighty grandfather, ‘Chief,’<a class="noteRef" id="n206.55src" href="#n206.55">55</a> let you have his skin. It was he who took his own back.” It was an islet lying in
front of point Skwai that lent him his clothing so that he might use it to kill Qꜝā′g̣awa-i.
</p>
<p>And after that he again arrived at the town of Łg̣adᴀ′n. Now he left his Qꜝā′g̣awa-i
skin there. He took his copper bow and four arrows, but the weasel skin he tied in
his hair. He wanted to show them to his mother so that she would be pleased. [Because
he wore them] Those-born-at-Skedans have them as crests.
</p>
<p>Then he went to his mother. And his mother was pleased with him. Now he showed the
copper arrows and the [skin of] Qꜝā′g̣awa-i he had killed to his mother and said that
future generations coming out from her should wear them as crests, besides possessing
the songs.
</p>
<p>And his mother asked him: “Did they call you lakꜝî′l?”<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n206.47asrc" href="#n204.47">47</a> And he said they did. Then he explained to her. “When I was of some height, and had
been killing all sorts of birds, I said I would kill Qꜝā′g̣awa-i,” whereupon they
used to say of me: “Put coals on the lips of that common person.” Instead [of being
angry] his mother laughed at him. His mother foretold what they would say to him when
he set out to help them.
</p>
<p id="ch3.4.n" class="small">This story, which practically includes three, is one of the most important and interesting
of all Haida stories, for, while two of the preceding are largely Tsimshian and the
Raven story is by no means confined to the Queen Charlotte islands, here we <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>have heroes and places dealt with which are strictly insular, forming true Haida “hero
tales.” The first two sections are of particular importance and were especially well
known. The second version of the story of Stone-ribs is of peculiar interest as coming
from a man of the town of Ninstints, where the descendants of the people of Łg̣adᴀ′n
afterward lived, and where this particular myth appears to have been especially treasured.
Sī′xa, the word which I have translated “Upward,” means more strictly “About-in-the-air,”
referring perhaps to the escape of this hero from his house in the form of a cinder.
“Stone-ribs” was the translation given me for G̣odᴀñxē′wat by my interpreter, but
g̣ō′dᴀñ is also applied to one who discovers hidden things. The word for rib is xē′wī.

<p class="first center">[Told by John Sky of Those-born-at-Skedans]
</p>
<p>Including their mother and their sister there were ten of them. Bad things came through
the eldest.<a class="noteRef" id="n210.1src" href="#n210.1">1</a> His younger brothers were like the supernatural beings. One day one of his younger
brothers went out and shouted “Hū-ū-ū-ū-ī.”<a class="noteRef" id="n210.2src" href="#n210.2">2</a> Then a cloud came out of the ocean. It came down in front of Gū′łg̣a.<a class="noteRef" id="n210.3src" href="#n210.3">3</a> One stood in the place [which it touched] and they wrestled with each other. After
they had wrestled for a while the younger brother of Supernatural-being-who-went-naked
was pushed down, and he bewitched him. “Go to the flint point which sticks out in
the rear of my father’s house,” [he said], and he went thither with noise (i.e., quickly).
</p>
<p>By and by the one who was born next to him also went out and shouted. He called in
the same way as the other had done, and again the cloud came into the inlet. Again
a person stood in the place [which it touched] and wrestled with him. After they had
wrestled together for a while, he again knocked him down and said as before: “Go to
the flint point which sticks out in the rear of my father’s house.” Then he went up
into the air with noise.
</p>
<p>Now he treated all seven in the same way. Afterward their mother wept. When she was
through weeping, she blew her nose out (i.e., cleared her throat) and said: “My eldest
son is nothing. My mind is so (i.e., sad) all of the time.”
</p>
<p>Her daughter always took care of the fire. Every time they went to bed Supernatural-being-who-went-naked
slept in the place where the fire had been. He was weak. He was unable to sit up.
</p>
<p>Now he heard what his mother kept saying about him. Then he called to his sister:
“Sister, come and bring out one of your mother’s stone boxes.” His sister poured some
[water] into one, and, as he crept thither, he fell on his side and almost fainted.
After he had lain there for a while he started to creep to it again, and he crept
into it.
</p>
<p>Then his buttocks were floating, and his sister picked up a poker and pressed on his
buttocks. After his sister had pressed upon him for a while, she took away the stick
from him. Lo, his buttocks were covered with water. And, after he had been in the
water for a while, he stretched himself in it. He burst it.
</p>
<p>Then his sister poured some water into another one, and he got into it. After he had
been in it a short time (lit., the length of a hand), he burst it by stretching. Then
he got into another. That, too, he burst with his knees.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now his sister poured some water into the remaining one. As soon as he had got into
it he stretched himself. He burst that also.
</p>
<p>Then he went into the sea in front of Gū′łg̣a. And after he had been in the water
for a while something touched him lightly. When he grasped for it he pulled off the
tail of a flounder and threw it ashore. After he had been in the sea a while longer
he seized the tail of a halibut. He also seized the tail of a porpoise and the tail
of a white porpoise.<a class="noteRef" id="n211.4src" href="#n211.4">4</a> And after he had been in the sea a while longer he seized a whale’s tail. “But steam
those,” said he to his sister.
</p>
<p>After he had been in the sea a very much longer time something touched him. He grasped
for it. He felt nothing. After he had been in the sea for another space of time something
again touched him, and he reached quickly ahead of it. Something slender was in his
hand. Then his hand began to slip off, and he seized it with both hands. Now something
pulled him away. At Łg̣a′-ixa<a class="noteRef" id="n211.5src" href="#n211.5">5</a> he got a new foothold. After some time the bottom of the island cracked. Then he
fastened it around his head and came back up the inlet. He passed close in front of
Gū′łg̣a and lay still at the mouth of Xā′nᴀ.<a class="noteRef" id="n211.6src" href="#n211.6">6</a>
</p>
<p>After he had been in the water there for a while something came down from the head
of the creek, making a noise as it descended, and he listened as he stood there. Then
the sound came near to him. Now he looked in that direction. Fallen trees came down
toward him, striking against each other as they came. They came near him. They came
straight toward him. Then he ran ashore from them.
</p>
<p>Upon this all the vegetation in the forest and all kinds of birds in the woods called
him a coward. “Is this the one who is trying to obtain power for himself? His power
is weak.” Then he jumped into the water again, and they came upon him, striking together.
When they struck him he felt nothing. What had become old rotten trees floated away
from him.
</p>
<p>And after he had been in the sea a while longer ice came down, striking together on
the way. And again he ran away from it, and they said he was a coward. Then he again
jumped into the water to meet them. After they had struck on each side of him they
floated away, transformed into some soft substance.
</p>
<p>After he had been in the water for another space of time rocks came floating down,
striking together, and he ran away from them. They again told him he was a coward,
and he again went into the water. And they struck upon him. They became brittle rock
and floated away from him.
</p>
<p>After he had been in the sea still longer he heard some one walking toward him. He
looked in that direction. Someone short and broad with red skin was coming toward
him. He held a knot in one hand and some g̣ōdañxō′sgî boughs.<a class="noteRef" id="n211.7src" href="#n211.7">7</a> On the other side he held some kwē′aogia′gadañ twigs<a class="noteRef" id="n211.8src" href="#n211.8">8</a> and some seaweed.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>And he said to him: “Come, let me whip you, grandson.” He went to him and faced him.
Then he struck him with the knot. He did not feel it. Instead, it broke in pieces.
And he struck him also with the g̣ōdañxō′sgî. He did not feel it. And he also struck
him on his back with the kwē′aogia′gadañ. He did not feel it. Then he struck him with
the seaweed. He almost touched the earth with his head.
</p>
<p>Then they seized each other. He pushed Greatest-strong-man down. Then he smiled at
him, and went toward the woods upon the ice. Landward stood a dead tree on the sea
side of which a dead limb stood out which he tried to pull off. He could not do it.
But he (the human being) went over to it and pulled it out. And he said to him: “Now,
grandson, go home, for your things are there.” And he went down the inlet.
</p>
<p>After he had swum along for a while, he stood up at Gū′łg̣a. And, after he had stood
near the door for a while, he entered and dried himself near the fire. He asked of
his mother, who was weaving near the wall: “Mother, have you any?” “Yes, chief, my
son; when something made you and shut you in the womb I had some made for you. They
are here.” Then his mother hunted in a box, brought out two sky blankets,<a class="noteRef" id="n212.9src" href="#n212.9">9</a> and gave them to him.
</p>
<p>Then he sat down on one of the bedsteads belonging to his younger brothers. He broke
it by sitting. And he broke another by sitting on it. After he had broken all by sitting
on them he made one for himself. And he also broke that by sitting on it. And, after
a stronger one with yellow cedar corner posts was finished, that, too, broke down.
And he gave it up. Then he fastened the pokers lying near the fire together in the
shape of a cross, laid dead salmon-berry bushes across them, laid the planks on top
of these, and sat down upon them. That, however, was strong. Then he went to bed.
</p>
<p>Very early next day he went out toward the woods. After he had traveled along for
a while upon a faint trail, [he came to] a dead fallen tree lying across the trail.
There a shrew<a class="noteRef" id="n212.10src" href="#n212.10">10</a> with cranberries in her mouth was vainly endeavoring to climb over it. Then he put
her over and passed by her.
</p>
<p>He came to a mountain covered with devil’s-club and began eating it. And when he was
half through evening came upon him, and he stayed there over night. And next day he
again began eating. When evening came he had eaten all.
</p>
<p>And the last he ate he spit out and said: “Perhaps I shall become a wā′sg̣o if I swim
about so much.” Then something up the inlet said to him: “Ah! Red-backed-grouse<a class="noteRef" id="n212.11src" href="#n212.11">11</a> hears your voice.” From down the inlet something else said: “Ah! ʟꜝuqaᴀ′ndas<a class="noteRef" id="n212.12src" href="#n212.12">12</a> hears your voice.” Then he went home.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>Next day he again went toward the woods. There the mouse<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n213.10src" href="#n212.10">10</a> was trying to climb over. Again he put her across. And, after he had traveled for
a while, he came to a mountain covered with x̣î′lg̣oga.<a class="noteRef" id="n213.13src" href="#n213.13">13</a> Then he ate it, stayed there all night, and continued eating next day. When he swallowed
the last of it, he spit out part. He spoke the same words as before. And beings spoke
to him as they had done before. Then he went home and went to bed.
</p>
<p>Very early next day he went out to challenge some one to a wrestling match. When he
started to wrestle with the thing which had destroyed his younger brothers, he said:
“Now, when you throw me down, stand awaiting me.” Immediately they seized each other.
Then he was thrown down. As soon as that happened, he (the opponent) pronounced the
words.
</p>
<p>And after he had gone through the air for a while, he came to the flint. At once he
rubbed a medicine Mouse-woman had given him upon himself. Now, when he struck on it,
he pulled it down. At that time his younger brothers’ bones burst out of it. Then
he spit medicine upon them. And as soon as he got down [he found] the other still
standing there waiting for him. Then he threw him down. “Future people will see you.”
He became a kind of brittle rock.<a class="noteRef" id="n213.14src" href="#n213.14">14</a>
</p>
<p>After that his younger brothers again disappeared.
</p>
<p>After he had lain in bed awhile day broke, and he began to think of the animal he
had put over [the log]. Then he went thither. Lo, she was again trying to climb over.
He put her across. And he watched to see which way she went. Then she went in at the
butt end of a clump of ferns. And a house stood there.
</p>
<p>Then she said to him: “Come in, my son; news has come that you are going to borrow
something from me.” Then he entered to her, and she let him sit down next to her.
Then she turned to the wall. She took a tray out of one of her boxes. On both sides
of it sat [carved] mice. She placed a piece of dried salmon which was in it before
him. And he thought: “I have been fasting a long time. What a small thing I am going
to eat.” Then she said to him: “Eat it. However small it looks, it can never be consumed.”
He took it. While doing so he looked. It was still there. And he again picked it up.
He was unable to consume it, and she put [the tray] back.
</p>
<p>Then she again turned round toward the wall. She put a single cranberry in front of
him. Then he picked it up with a spoon. That, too, he was unable to consume.
</p>
<p>Then she turned round again. And she took something blue out of the box.<a class="noteRef" id="n213.15src" href="#n213.15">15</a> Then she bit off part for him. “Here is something for you when you think of eating
medicine, Go up to Gū′łg̣a lake. There lives Among-the-hemlock-boughs, who destroyed
your younger brothers. When you come to the shore opposite him where the ground <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>is trodden down by many feet, whistle for him, and when he comes out to you and has
nearly reached you drop on the ground quickly. Then you will come to yourself sitting
in his belly. Put medicine upon yourself. Then you will restore your younger brothers.
And when your younger brothers are gone again run quickly to Sealion-town. Then climb
into the tree which lies seaward at the end of the trail running inland. When [a creature]
comes to you from the sea push the thing you are going to make into his ear, and when
he staggers about wounded climb into the tree again. At that place you will restore
your younger brothers again. After all have disappeared again and you start after
them you will keep on going forever as one with supernatural power.”
</p>
<p>Then he went away. After he had been in bed for a while, day began to break, and he
went up to the woods and reached his destination. There was a place there trodden
bare by many feet. The footprints of human beings were in it.
</p>
<p>Then, just as day began to break, he whistled. After he had done this for a while
something like a person with his hair floating upon the water came along. When it
got near him, he dropped flat, and, after some space of time had elapsed, lo, he came
to himself in its belly. Then he put the medicine upon himself and stretched himself
in its belly. His younger brothers’ bones poured out. He, too, was thrown out on top
of them.
</p>
<p>Then the hemlock was moving there. And he went to get it. He struck it. It was as
when something is split up fine. Then he laid aside two branches and took two short
ones. Then he threw one [of the latter] so that it went into a tree. And he threw
another one. It stuck endwise into a hemlock. He spit after it. And he said: “Future
people will use these as fishhooks in getting food.”<a class="noteRef" id="n214.16src" href="#n214.16">16</a>
</p>
<p>Then he spit the medicine upon his younger brothers. They arose. And he said: “Go
together to the place where you used to sit.” Then he, too, followed them, and, after
they had enjoyed seeing each other for a while, again one was gone. One after the
other all seven disappeared.
</p>
<p>Then he whittled the hemlock limbs. He sharpened the ends and put them over the fire.
Then he took these at midnight and went to Sealion-town. And he climbed up into a
tree which stood at the end of the trail.
</p>
<p>After he had sat there for a while two pieces of pitchwood came burning out of the
ocean like lanterns. They came below him like lanterns. Wonderful to see, a wā′sg̣o<a class="noteRef" id="n214.17src" href="#n214.17">17</a> came and stood there. At the tree lying seaward it sat. It was coming to him. It
had a whale in its mouth. It had another one in the curl of its tail.
</p>
<p>And, when it got just under him, he sat down between its ears. And he pushed the hemlock
limbs into its ears. Then he again pulled <span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>himself up into the tree. It staggered around underneath. At daybreak, when the raven
called, it fell as if thrown down.<a class="noteRef" id="n215.18src" href="#n215.18">18</a>
</p>
<p>Then he pushed it about [preparing to skin it] and was going to cut it open. But it
thundered and lightened. Then he skinned it and cut it open. He caused his younger
brothers’ bones to burst out and spit medicine upon them. They rose, and he said:
“Go to the place where you used to sit.” The next day one was again missing and the
day after another. It went on in this way until all seven were again gone.
</p>
<p>And, after he had sat around for a while, he started off aimlessly. After he had gone
along for a while he heard something in the middle of the island which sounded like
a drum. Then he went to it. Lo! he came to a trail. It had been recently trodden upon.
After he had traveled on this for a while he came to a house. The door was on one
side of the front. Inside of the house something made a noise like a drum.
</p>
<p>Then he looked in. A woman, wearing a brownish red cedar-bark blanket, twisted threads.
The doing of that caused the noise like a drum. He sat outside of the door which was
much trodden about. Then he went along and looked down. There was a salmon-berry bush
newly broken off. And he took it up. He punched her buttocks with it as she sat working
turned toward the wall. Then she turned round and smiled upon him, and he talked with
her for a while.
</p>
<p>While he was still talking he heard a voice [saying]: “Huk, huk, huk, huk, huk, huk,
huk, huk.” Then he looked toward it. Lo! his younger brothers were trying to run apart
from each other. Then he went to them and spit medicine upon them. He put some on
himself as well and tried to pull them away. He was unable to do it. Then he tried
it again. Again he was unable to do it. That was Gā′gix̣it-woman, they say.”<a class="noteRef" id="n215.19src" href="#n215.19">19</a>
</p>
<p>Being unsuccessful he went home. Then he came to Gū′łg̣a. He was going to enter his
mother’s house, yet in spite of himself he passed by in front. Then he turned toward
it again and, when he was near the door, he seized a pole which was in front of the
house. But it came away in his hand.
</p>
<p>When he could not succeed in entering he wandered off aimlessly. Soon he arrived at
the middle of the top of the island. After he had traveled about a while he came to
an open space. Then he sat down there. After he had sat there for a while he looked
at himself. Lo! he sat there naked, deprived of both his blankets. Some thick bushes
were there.
</p>
<p>Then he turned his back to the sunshine. He held his head down with his forehead in
his hands. While he was sitting thus something touched him. He looked for it but saw
nothing. Then he got ready for it, and, when this happened again, he grasped in front
of it. <span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>It was in his hand. It was soft. It felt like fur. It was like something phosphorescent.
</p>
<p>Then he skinned it and used salmon-berry bushes on which to stretch it. But lo! it
was slack in the middle. Then he put it on a larger one. And he laid it out in the
sunshine. He was going to make blankets out of it. It became nearly dry. He was glad.
And, when it was nearly dry, things from the north end of the island and the south
end of the island shouted “Wā-ā-ā-ā-ā, Supernatural-being-who-went-naked is stretching
his sky blankets.” They laughed at him. Then he bent down his head. After he had sat
there ashamed for a while he left his blankets.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n216.19src" href="#n215.19">19</a>
</p>
<p>Now he started on. He traveled around and around this island. One time, after he had
traveled for a while, he heard some one sobbing bitterly. He went thither. A house
stood there. He ran to it so fast that he kept falling. Then he looked in. In the
rear of the house stood one with tears running down and pitch on his face. His earrings
were long. From the ends of them small human beings hung. Their throats hung downward.
Their arms were moving as they hung.
</p>
<p>He struck the ground with his baton and cried hard. “Thinking to restore his younger
brothers again as he had twice revived them, the supernatural being started after
them. While he was going, the supernatural being went on forever.” So he heard him
put words into the song about himself as he wept.
</p>
<p>And his boxes all had their ends toward the fire. There were four tiers of them. Then
he wanted to look into them. And he ran about. After he had run around looking for
something for a while he found a big rock, long and narrow, and he put it on his shoulder.
Then he threw it up on top of the house. He pulled himself up after it. Now he made
a hole above him and let the stone fall in. It struck his head. He dropped dead without
moving.
</p>
<p>Then he jumped down. He entered the door. He opened the box lying nearest to him.
It was all full of moose hides.<a class="noteRef" id="n216.20src" href="#n216.20">20</a> Then he went to the rear of the house also. There, too, he opened some. Then he put
five [hides] upon his back and went away. After he had run along for a while, lo!
he heard his baton sound. Then he came near him and took one of his hides back. He
put it on his shoulder. He did the same to all five and went away from him. And he
looked in the place where he had been. He had vanished.
</p>
<p>Then he went after him. Lo! he was crying out the same words as before. Then he turned
back quickly and picked up a larger stone than the one he had before taken upon his
shoulders. Now he put it on top of the house and pulled himself up after it. Then
he made a hole right above him. He dropped the stone in. He fell down.
</p>
<p>At once he jumped in, piled five blankets one over the other, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>went away with them. Before he had gone far, however, he took these also from him.
He remained in the same place looking at him. Now he was unable to kill him. That
was Master Weeper.
</p>
<p>And, after he had traveled about for a while, he came to a swampy place where skunk
cabbage grew and jumped across it.<a class="noteRef" id="n217.21src" href="#n217.21">21</a> Then, after he had gone on for a while, he came to a deserted town. A little smoke
came out of the house in the middle. He went to it and entered. And an old man lay
there, back to the fire.<a class="noteRef" id="n217.22src" href="#n217.22">22</a> He looked at him. Then he arose and gave him something to eat. But he did not give
him anything to drink.
</p>
<p>By and by he said: “Hū; I am thirsty. I will go after some water for myself.” “Don’t
do it, chief; those that destroyed my village live there. Go over to the corner and
drink there like me, your mighty grandfather, who am doing without anything else.”
</p>
<p>Then he went thither. It was a swampy place, full of skunk cabbage. And he turned
around and defecated into it. And, after he had defecated into it, he said to him:
“Manure is floating about here in it.” Then he said: “Alas! I wonder what I shall
do.”
</p>
<p>Then he said to him: “Hū; I am thirsty.” And he said to him: “Don’t go, chief; the
things that destroyed my village are there.” But, without heeding him, he took the
bucket and went for some. And, after the water had flowed down four times, he took
some.
</p>
<p>He did not know what happened to him. To his astonishment he came to himself sitting
in its belly. Then he stretched himself in its belly. He burst it, and bones burst
out of its belly. He put the bones together. If one leg was lost he repaired it with
salmon-berry bushes. He spit medicine upon them. At once they got up. He revived the
right side of the town.
</p>
<p>Immediately after that the water flowed down continuously. Then he got some in the
bucket, went in, and said: “Grandfather, drink.” Then he stretched his hand toward
it. After he had looked at it for a while, he turned away from it. He did not drink.
</p>
<p>After [Supernatural-being-who-went-naked] had sat there for a while, he said: “Hū,
everywhere people eat things found at low tide. I want some devilfish. I am going
to get some devilfish.” “Do not do it, chief; the thing that destroyed my village
lives there.” But, without listening to what was said, he started off.
</p>
<p>In the corner of the house on the side toward the door were two sticks for hunting
devilfish. Then he took both. And he gave him the following directions: “After he
has shot water from his mouth four times, punch in at him. That is the way to endeavor
to kill him.”
</p>
<p>Then he went. Something wonderful lived there. The supernatural devilfish shot water
at him, and it went right to the sky. After it had shot out water four times, he punched
it with a stick. But he <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>found himself in its belly. Then he spit medicine upon himself and stretched out in
its belly. He burst it. The mother of outbursts of human bones took place. Then he
put the bones together, and part were missing. And he repaired them with any common
material. Then he repaired their eyes in the same way and spit medicine upon them.
At once all went away. And he said: “When you get home, walk about there.”
</p>
<p>Then he dragged [the devilfish] along with the devilfish stick and threw it inside
the door. When he came in and sat down, Nᴀñkî′lsʟas looked at him. As he was looking
at him, Supernatural-being-who-went-naked said: “Now, grandfather, look about upon
your town.”
</p>
<p>Now he took his cane and went out with it. He looked to the right. To his great surprise
something wonderful had happened. People decorated with feathers and having their
faces painted walked about in rows. Then he also looked to the left. There things
were in the same condition. Then he entered.
</p>
<p>When he came in he brought out a urinal. And he threw some white, hard rock from a
box on which his head rested into the fire. After he had looked at it a while, and
it had become red-hot, he put it into the urinal. Then he put the end of a sharp-pointed
thing, half blue, half red,<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n218.15src" href="#n213.15">15</a> into this and held part of the clothing he wore over his nose.
</p>
<p>Then he called for him. “This way, my son; come and sit near me.” Then he went to
him, and he pressed on his nose with the stick and pressed it down. Now he took off
the sea-bass, bullhead, and tomcod spines from him. After he had finished doing it
he fixed him up. Then he brought out a comb and combed him from the top of his head.
And he looked down. Lo! land-otter fur was piled up below. He did the same thing on
the other side of him. Nᴀñkî′lsʟas pressed something upon his nose with his fingers
because Supernatural-being-who-went-naked had the gā′gix̣īt smell.
</p>
<p>Then he combed his hair. He made it long, and he made two knots of hair at his neck.
He fastened them with a ribbon. He fixed him up with the blue part [of his stick].
After he had been at it for a while he poured water into a wash basin he owned and
said to Supernatural-being-who-went-naked: “Now, grandson, look at yourself.”<a class="noteRef" id="n218.23src" href="#n218.23">23</a>
</p>
<p>Then he looked at himself. He had put on [a painting of] red mottled [clouds] spotted
with black, such as lie out on the sea.<a class="noteRef" id="n218.24src" href="#n218.24">24</a> He looked at it and said “This is bad.” Then he wiped it off and put it into his
armpit. And, after he had put paint upon him for a while, he looked at himself again.
He had put on his face a red, striped [cloud], such as lie toward the north.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n218.24asrc" href="#n218.24">24</a> And he did not like that. Now he put more paint on him. He put broad stripes upon
his face, like those on the breast of a mallard. But he said that was good. He fixed
him up, because he had restored his town to life. And he gave him two sky blankets.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Nᴀñkî′lsʟas said to Supernatural-being-who-went-naked: “Now you better go. The
one your mind is troubled about lives near by. When the servants come for water throw
yourself into the water and make yourself appear like one through whom worthless things
come. The ones coming first will not want to touch you; the last one will take good
care of you.”
</p>
<p>Then he started and sat down by a water hole near Kaisun,<a class="noteRef" id="n219.25src" href="#n219.25">25</a> on the west coast. After he had sat there a while they came after water. Then they
landed. They picked up the bucket. They came near him. And, when they got near him,
he made himself like those into whom worthless things come and threw himself into
the water. And he lay floating about in it.
</p>
<p>Then the one who came first threw herself backward. “Yuwai′yᴀ, something is floating
about in her water (i.e., the chief-woman’s).” Then the middle one said: “Throw him
out with a stick.” Now the last one, who was lame, said: “Handle him carefully. After
he has drunk whale soup he will become stronger.”
</p>
<p>Then they broke off the stalk of a salmon-berry bush and took him out carefully. Now
they got the water, and, after they had taken it down to the canoe, they remembered
him. The lame one brought him in with a stick and put him in the bailing hole.
</p>
<p>And after they had landed they carried up the water. They steamed the whale. Again
they forgot about him. Then she who was lame thought of him and said: “We have forgotten
about a crooked thing which floated about in the chief-woman’s drinking water.”
</p>
<p>Then the daughter of The-one-in-the-sea said: “Hurry and get him.” And the lame one
went and got him. She brought him up with a stick. He was bent across the salmon-berry
stalk. Then they had him sit on the side toward the door. He warmed his hands at the
fire. Then they handed him whale soup, but, while he was reaching for it and was moving
it toward his mouth, he spilled it all. Then they all laughed at him and gave him
some more. The same thing happened to that.
</p>
<p>The chief-woman lived at Tcꜝī′da.<a class="noteRef" id="n219.26src" href="#n219.26">26</a> And next day they went fishing with a net. They pulled in a whale. And they cut it
up.
</p>
<p>While they were away he warmed himself on the side of the house toward the door a
while and said: “Chief-woman, you [let me get something].” Then she said to him: “Go
and get what you are talking about.” But he crept over to her. He touched the chief-woman.
Then she seized him on each side of his head near his ears and knocked him against
the floor planks, holding him by the hair. And she said to him: “Go and sit on the
side toward the door, you common thing.” And he crept over there. Again he sat near
the door.
</p>
<p>After he had sat there for a while the chief-woman said to him, making the sound of
throwing out saliva between her teeth: “Gîtgît,<a class="noteRef" id="n219.27src" href="#n219.27">27</a> the slave they say I am without, go and get firewood.” Then he crept <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>out and came out of his skin outside. Then he seized with both hands a spruce, good
for burning and covered with dead limbs mingled with green ones, which stood upon
a knoll, and he pulled it up, roots and all. Then he threw it down from the knoll.
It was broken in pieces below. Then he collected the pieces. And he carried up the
bark, crept in, and put it into the fire. He piled [the wood] there, end up [in the
usual way].
</p>
<p>The servants had pulled in a whale. They were happy. Then, after he had tried to communicate
with the lame one for a while, he told her about himself. “I have firewood for you
back here. Go and get it. I am Supernatural-being-who-went-naked. Do not tell any
one about me.”
</p>
<p>Then the slaves were told to get firewood, and they brought it in. And [the chief-woman]
again made a noise with her lips. “I guess it must have been Gîtgît who chopped down
this firewood,” she<a class="noteRef" id="n220.28src" href="#n220.28">28</a> said to him.
</p>
<p>One day he crept out. He got out of his skin. Then he stopped making himself old.
He determined to marry the chief-woman.
</p>
<p>Then he put upon his face the painting that Nᴀñkî′lsʟas had placed there first. He
put on his two sky blankets. And, after he had stood there for a while, one of the
servants came out. As soon as she had looked at him, although still at a distance,
she came toward him with her arms stretched out. “No, no, no,” he said to her, and
she went in from him crying.
</p>
<p>Then she said: “Come! look at Supernatural-being-who-went-naked who stands just outside.”
And another went out to him. He also refused her. He refused ten. Then she who was
lame went to him. But he put his arm around her, and they stood there together.
</p>
<p>By and by he entered and married the chief-woman. He stayed with her for some time.
Every evening there was a star at the rear of the house. He thought nothing about
it. One day something passing under his pillow said: “Supernatural-being-who-went-naked,
does the eating of black cod stick you here?”<a class="noteRef" id="n220.29src" href="#n220.29">29</a> After some time had passed without his having thought anything about this, it said
the same thing again.
</p>
<p>One morning, as he still lay in bed with his wife, he asked to set a net. And his
wife said to him: “Wait until I explain to you. You have not strength enough to let
it out farther. They never let out more than one.”<a class="noteRef" id="n220.30src" href="#n220.30">30</a>
</p>
<p>Then he took the net which was hung in a corner and went to the point. Whales swam
about in the water. He let out two [meshes]. Two were in it. And he could not pull
it in. The other [meshes] were also pulled into the water. All five were pulled in.
Then he went away. And where he lay he breathed hard [from the exertion].
</p>
<p>Then his wife asked him: “Were the meshes of the net pulled out?” <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>“Yes,” said he. Instead [of being angry] his wife laughed at him. “That is all right,
for I will go to my father and get it.”<a class="noteRef" id="n221.31src" href="#n221.31">31</a>
</p>
<p>The day after she went to her father by canoe. All of the servants went along with
the chief-woman. Supernatural-being-who-went-naked also went. They started. After
they had gone along for a while, they came in sight of the town. Then they landed,
and her father came down to meet her. And he asked his daughter: “Why do you come,
chief-woman, my daughter?” “Why, father, we came after the net.” “It is there in the
house, chief-woman, my daughter.”
</p>
<p>And he was glad to see Supernatural-being-who-went-naked. Then they went in, and four
hard white stones were put into the fire. When they became red hot, they brought a
tray made of white rock out from the corner. They put them into it and placed it in
front of him.
</p>
<p>Then his wife cried, “Hᴀ<sup>n</sup>! hᴀ<sup>n</sup>! every time I try to be happy (i.e., to be married) you use this sort of weapon.”
Then he told his wife not to say a word. And, after he had swallowed his medicine,
he picked up one with a spoon and swallowed it. It even went through the floor planks.
He did the same with all four.
</p>
<p>Then they gave him a wash basin. After his wife had also washed her hands, they brought
out five black cod. And she told her husband not to eat them. “It is something different,”
she said to him. Then they put these in front of him, and, after he had sat there
for a while, she said: “He says that is not what it is.” Then [the servant] put it
back and they threw them out.
</p>
<p>Then they put some more in front of him. Those, too, he did not eat. And she said:
“He says that that is also something different, father.” Then they threw away the
steaming box and brought another out, and they brought out five more black cod. Then
she said to her husband: “They are black cod.” They cut them crosswise and steamed
them. When they were cooked, they put them into a dish. And before they had taken
these, she picked one up. “Take care of the head and bones of this.” And she gave
him another. She gave him those parts of all five black cod.
</p>
<p>And she said to her husband: “Do not let them go. He will take them out from inside
your clothing so that you will not feel it.” And she asked him many times: “Have you
the heads still?” “Yes, here they are.” Next day they started off. Again she asked
her husband: “Have you the heads?” “Yes, here they are.” “Have you the black-cod heads?”
“Yes, here they are.” “Have you the black-cod heads?” “No-o-o I wonder why He-who-has-spines-for-earrings
turned round smiling.”<a class="noteRef" id="n221.32src" href="#n221.32">32</a>
</p>
<p>Hu hu hu hu hu, great quantities of black cod were put into the canoe. Then they landed
and unloaded the black cod. And it was evening, and they went to bed.
</p>
<p>After many nights had passed, the something which had spoken <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>under his pillow before he again heard going along and saying: “Supernatural-being-who-went-naked,
does the black cod stick you here? Because you made Nᴀñkî′lsʟas’ town alive, he restored
your younger brothers to life by letting himself be born from your mother. He sat
early in the morning between rocks with white and black bands.<a class="noteRef" id="n222.33src" href="#n222.33">33</a> Being in love with part of you, he has also come to you.” And he looked out. Lo!
he saw the tail of a marten pass in through the star.<a class="noteRef" id="n222.34src" href="#n222.34">34</a>
</p>
<p>Then he went thither. To his surprise there lay a woman asleep with Nᴀñkî′lsʟas with
the upper part of her blanket fallen away leaving her uncovered. Then he pressed upon
her with his hands and she said to him: “I used to want you, but lo! you got around
late.”
</p>
<p>And after that he sat down near the fire feeling unhappy. Then his wife asked him:
“Why are you so sad?” “I am sad because I left my mother not far from here,” he said,
deceiving her. Then he started. He put black cod into his canoe and started off. Then
he came into Skidegate channel and reached his [younger] brothers’ town. Lo! his eight
younger brothers came down to meet him.
</p>
<p>Then they went in. And his younger brothers only cared to have Nᴀñkî′lsʟas for an
elder brother. They did not care about Supernatural-being-who-went-naked. Before they
even gave food, Supernatural-being-who-went-naked began to give them something to
eat.
</p>
<p>Nᴀñkî′lsʟas had a bedstead in the rear of the house. Clouds were over his head. They
could not see his face. She (the wife of Supernatural-being-who-went-naked) cut the
black cod crosswise and steamed them. Then they told Nᴀñkî′lsʟas to sit near the fire
and put down a wash basin for him. And the cloud upon his face crossed [the room].
He sat there washing his hands. Then they set black cod before him. They saw only
his hands.
</p>
<p>His younger brothers ate with him, but Supernatural-being-who-went-naked sat with
his wife on the side of the house toward the door. Nᴀñkî′lsʟas did not walk down.
The clouds rose. He was fastened to them. Then the clouds rested with him behind the
place where the wash basin was.
</p>
<p>Now, when they were through, the cloud rose with him, and his body was again to be
seen on the bedstead. Then he (Nᴀñkî′lsʟas) called to his sister. After she had gone
to him and he had talked with her for a while, she went out. She brought in cranberries.
The tray had the figure of a gā′gix̣īt upon it. After he had sat eating for a while
he stopped, and his younger brothers ate the rest.
</p>
<p>Then she again put stones into the fire. Then they laid the wash basin down again,
and the clouds again rose with him. Again he came down there and sat down, and they
put black cod in front of him. Then he ate with his younger brothers. At that time
they did not see his face. Then the wife of Supernatural-being-who-went-naked was
sad.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>They say that Nᴀñkî′lsʟas was in love with Gā′gix̣īt woman in order to restore the
brothers of Supernatural-being-who-went-naked. In order to restore the town of Supernatural-being-who-went-naked
to life he had let himself be born from the mother of Supernatural-being-who-went-naked.
Then the clouds rose. Again he sat up high.
</p>
<p>Again [Nᴀñkî′lsʟas] called to his sister: “Sister, come to me,” and his sister said:
“Hū hū, always, when you send me after a thing, you are going to give me something.
By and by you take it away from me again.”
</p>
<p>Upon that he threw something down to her. It fell with a noise like that of a drum.
At once she went to get it. She covered it up with her blanket. Then the wife of Supernatural-being-who-went-naked
recognized the thing she used to let her daughter have.<a class="noteRef" id="n223.35src" href="#n223.35">35</a>
</p>
<p>Then she cried: “Ha<sup>n</sup>-a ha<sup>n</sup>-a, I thought that I let only my daughter have that.” Then her mother-in-law said
to her: “Stop, chief-woman; wherever the supernatural beings are settled they always
wear it as a crest. Chief-woman, it belonged to your husband’s sister and her brother
(Nᴀñkî′lsʟas). He is simply fooling her with the thing you are talking about.” At
once she stopped crying. She really saw it. But still she believed what her mother-in-law
said.
</p>
<p>On the next day his brother’s wife again gave them black cod to eat. When he sat up
again he called to his sister. After he had talked to her for a while she came down
and sat near Supernatural-being-who-went-naked, who sat with his wife. And she said:
“He wants something that he says your husband owns.” Then he did not know what [Nᴀñkî′lsʟas]
referred to.
</p>
<p>By and by he thought of the skin of the wā′sg̣o he had killed. Then he ran toward
the mouth of the inlet. And he pulled himself up to the two cedar tops, between which
he kept it, and pulled off the wā′sg̣o’s tail. Then he started back with it. He returned
at once.
</p>
<p>Then he said to his wife: “This must be the thing they speak about.” Then she called
her sister-in-law and gave the wā′sg̣o tail to Nᴀñkî′lsʟas. After he had looked at
it for a while he put it on top of his hat. It looked nice there.<a class="noteRef" id="n223.36src" href="#n223.36">36</a>
</p>
<p>At that time they again steamed black cod. And lo! the clouds again arose. Then his
younger brothers ate the black cod. Then his mind was sick. Now she turned around
and began weaving. After she had done this for a while, lo! her brother-in-law had
put himself around her. He looked out at her from her clothing. She looked toward
the rear of the house for her brother-in-law. The form of Nᴀñkî′lsʟas still sat up
there. Then they lay there together.<a class="noteRef" id="n223.37src" href="#n223.37">37</a>
</p>
<p>But still she told her husband, Supernatural-being-who-went-naked, not to be in love
with anyone. “Do not go with anyone, or I will go down to my father.”
</p>
<p>Then her husband began getting water in a water-tight basket in which floated a hawk
feather. Every time he came back she pulled <span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>out the feather. Globular drops of water fell off, and she drank. One time he lay
with one he was in love with. And, when he came home, his wife pulled out the feather.
The water adhered to it.
</p>
<p>Immediately she became angry. Her labret moved as if some one had shaken it. Then
she hunted in her box. At the same time her tears fell as if something were poured
out. Taking something out of it she put it into her mouth. It was a white powder.
She spit it upon her hands and rubbed it on the soles of her feet. Then her husband,
who sat near her, took some that fell about. He at once rubbed it upon the soles of
his feet. She did this because she was going to leave him.
</p>
<p>Then she went down to the beach, and he followed her and went away with her on the
surface of the sea. She did not look at him. Then she said to Supernatural-being-who-went-naked:
“You better go back from me before I look at you.” And he said: “What kind of look
is this dangerous look?” Then she looked toward him, and he went right under water.
There was not a sign of him. And she entered her father’s house.
</p>
<p>Then she said to her father: “Father, I made him fall in by looking. I looked toward
him. Come! try to fish him out.” Then her father pulled apart the stone floor planks.
He fished for him between them. Then he pulled him out, with nothing but his joints
holding together. Then he spit medicine upon him, and he got up and went toward his
place.
</p>
<p>And, after he arrived there, they sent for Master Carpenter. Then he had a mountain
placed upon ten canoes. And his younger brothers were settled there one after the
other. Then he put a sky blanket upon his sister and seated her on the mainland. And
he seated his mother on the Haida country.<a class="noteRef" id="n224.38src" href="#n224.38">38</a>
</p>
<p>Now, he put on a dancing blanket and dancing leggings and started along on land near
his younger brothers [who were going along in their canoe]. He bent over as he ran,
and farther off he stood up straight. In that way Supernatural-being-who-went-naked
became the Swamp-robin.<a class="noteRef" id="n224.39src" href="#n224.39">39</a> And his younger brothers lay still on the water out at sea. People sometimes become
shamans [by getting power] out of that canoe.
</p>
<p class="small">Like the preceding this seems to be a strictly Haida story, although the gā′gix̣īt
idea was also popular among the Tlingit of Alaska. This fact, together with its length
and complication and the insight it gives into the mythology of the Haida people,
render it one of the most interesting of all. One of the myths obtained by me at Masset
bore this same name, but resembled it only in the concluding portion, the first part
being like that of He-who-got-supernatural-power-from-his-little-finger.

<p class="first center">[Told by John Sky of Those-born-at-Skedans]
</p>
<p>She was a chief’s child. She was a woman.<a class="noteRef" id="n227.1src" href="#n227.1">1</a> When she went out, they braced the hanging door open for her, and she went out frequently.<a class="noteRef" id="n227.2src" href="#n227.2">2</a> One day, when she came in, the stick slipped off, and the edge of the door touched
her upon the side and made her sore there. By and by a hole appeared there, and, when
the town people came to know that, her father gave orders to abandon her. Next day
they left her.
</p>
<p>Then she went down to the saltwater and washed her [sore]. There she put medicine
upon it. One day, when she was washing, some bloody looking matter stuck out. And
she was unable to pull it out. Then she again put medicine upon it and crept up to
the house.
</p>
<p>Next day she crept down to the water again, and, while she was washing it, she again
pulled at it with her finger nails. Lo, she pulled it out. Then she laid it upon a
stone, and, after she had put medicine on herself, picked it up and moved toward the
house. Then she bent pieces of cedar bark, placed it in them, and put it side of the
house outside.
</p>
<p>Now she went to bed. While her back was turned to the fire a child cried. Then she
rose quickly and, without standing up, ran out. And something inside the thing she
had bent together was crying. She looked. A child lay in it. And, after she had taken
it out, she washed it. Then she reared it. She had it as a companion.
</p>
<p>And very soon he began to creep. Before he had eaten anything he began to walk. One
day he started to cry. He said: “Ha ʟ̣”<a class="noteRef" id="n227.3src" href="#n227.3">3</a> Then she made a bow for him. She used a young hemlock limb. When it was finished,
she gave it to him. After he had looked at it he put it into the fire. She made them
for him out of all kinds of wood. Each time he did the same thing.
</p>
<p>By and by she made one for <span class="corr" id="xd32e24562" title="Source: himout">him out</span> of real yew. Wā-ā-ā-ā-ā′, it looked red. It was pretty. After he had looked at that,
too, for a while he threw it into the fire, and the blunt-pointed arrows along with
it.
</p>
<p>Then she pounded out copper for him. She hammered a string on so that it could not
be removed. She also hammered out two arrows. One had the figure of a weasel. The
other had the figure of a mouse on it. When she handed these to him he did not look
at them. He at once went off.
</p>
<p>After he had been gone for some time, he brought in some wrens<a class="noteRef" id="n227.4src" href="#n227.4">4</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>and said to his mother: “Pick and eat them.” Then his mother picked them and steamed
them. When they were cooked she ate them. His mother tried to have him eat some. But
he shook his head. He absolutely refused.
</p>
<p>Then he again went off. He came back. He brought many song sparrows,<a class="noteRef" id="n228.5src" href="#n228.5">5</a> and his mother steamed them and ate. But he did not eat. Next day he went off again.
He brought in a number of mallard,<a class="noteRef" id="n228.6src" href="#n228.6">6</a> and his mother plucked and singed them. She pulled them apart and ate one.
</p>
<p>And next day he started off again. He brought in a number of geese.<a class="noteRef" id="n228.7src" href="#n228.7">7</a> He went off the next day. He brought a white porpoise,<a class="noteRef" id="n228.8src" href="#n228.8">8</a> and he brought a hair seal.<a class="noteRef" id="n228.9src" href="#n228.9">9</a> The day after he brought a whale.<a class="noteRef" id="n228.10src" href="#n228.10">10</a> He had stopped hunting birds.
</p>
<p>Then he started off again. He stayed away longer than usual and brought in many flickers.<a class="noteRef" id="n228.11src" href="#n228.11">11</a> Then he said to his mother: “After you have skinned these, lay the sinews on one
side.” Then his mother skinned them and laid the sinews on one side. And, after she
had finished, she placed them together. She made five rows, and she sewed them together
with their own sinews. After she had finished he shook it. The flickers upon it went
flying back and forth.
</p>
<p>Then he stretched his mother’s house. He set up two planks in the rear of the house.
Between them he hung the blanket.
</p>
<p>Next day he went out and brought home woodpeckers.<a class="noteRef" id="n228.12src" href="#n228.12">12</a> Then she treated those in the same way in order to make a blanket. After she had
finished he went to it and shook it. Upon that, too, the birds flew about in a flock.
Then he went to bed. He ate nothing all that time. All that time he fasted.
</p>
<p>Then he again set out. After he had stayed away longer than before he brought in a
bunch of tanagers.<a class="noteRef" id="n228.13src" href="#n228.13">13</a> Those, too, his mother made [into a blanket]. When it was finished, he also went
to that. He shook it. Those also flew about upon it. He laid that, too, on top of
[the planks] in the rear of the house.
</p>
<p>Next day he started off again and brought home a bunch of <span lang="hax">sixᴀsʟdᴀ′lgaña</span>.<a class="noteRef" id="n228.14src" href="#n228.14">14</a> Those his mother also sewed into a blanket. And, when it was finished, he shook it.
They flew about upon it. He laid that upon [the planks] also.
</p>
<p>The next day he went out again. [He got] blue jays,<a class="noteRef" id="n228.15src" href="#n228.15">15</a> and his mother sewed those together.
</p>
<p>After that he again started off. After he had been absent for some time he returned
with the daughter of He-who-travels-behind-us,<a class="noteRef" id="n228.16src" href="#n228.16">16</a> whom he had married.
</p>
<p>After he had lived with her a while, one morning he continued to lie abed. While he
was still in bed, something went along under his pillow talking. “He-who-was-born-from-his-mother’s-side,
are you <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>awake? Do you not feel that the supernatural beings, whom people are afraid even to
think of, are gathering together against you?”
</p>
<p>Then he ran out. He saw nothing. And he went out again. He pulled along an old man
and made him sit at the end of the town. That was Heron,<a class="noteRef" id="n229.17src" href="#n229.17">17</a> they say.
</p>
<p>One day he was again lying in bed. Then something passed under his pillow saying the
same words as before. Then he seized his bow and went out. After he had looked about
on the surface of the salt water he glanced upward. A thunderbird flew about above
the town. It carried [his grandfather’s] town in its claws.
</p>
<p>Then he went to the old man and said to him: “Grandfather, they are coming after me.”
“What is the bow of the canoe like?” “A thunderbird is flying about above the town.
He carries a town in his talons.” And the old man said to him: “Now, brave man, shoot
it with arrows.”
</p>
<p>Now he shot it with the one that had the figure of a mouse upon it, and it dropped
the town. Lo and behold! he (the thunderbird) burst.<a class="noteRef" id="n229.18src" href="#n229.18">18</a> He put together their bones. If any of them was wanting, he repaired it with salmon-berry
bushes. Then he went home. He had restored his grandfather’s town.
</p>
<p>Again he lay in bed in the morning. Again something, passing beneath his pillow, said:
“He-who-was-born-from-his-mother’s-side, are you awake? Do you not feel that the supernatural
beings, whom people are afraid even to think of, are coming together against you?”
Then he seized his bow quickly and ran out. And around a point at one end of the town
came ten canoes with red bows.
</p>
<p>Then he went over to his grandfather. “Grandfather, they are coming to fight with
me by sea.” And his grandfather asked him what the bows of the canoes looked like.
He told him that the bows of the canoes were red. “Now, brave man, have the town people
pull î′nłîñ<a class="noteRef" id="n229.19src" href="#n229.19">19</a> out of the ground and spread it before them.” And he did as he had said. In a short
time they rolled their eyes upward. Those were the silver salmon,<a class="noteRef" id="n229.20src" href="#n229.20">20</a> they say.
</p>
<p>Still another time, while he was lying down, something passing under his pillow spoke
the same words as before. Then he picked up his bow and ran out. And he looked at
those who were coming. The bows of their canoes had vertical stripes.
</p>
<p>Then he again went to his grandfather. “They are coming by sea to fight with me.”
And he said: “Stop! brave man, what are the bows of their canoes like?” “The bows
of their canoes have vertical stripes on them.” “Now, brave man, have the town pull
up î′nłîñ and throw it about before them.” And so he had it done. At once their eyes
were rolled upward. They were the dog salmon,<a class="noteRef" id="n229.21src" href="#n229.21">21</a> they say. He-who-was-born-from-his-mother’s-side made them cowards by putting î′nłîñ-teeth<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n229.19asrc" href="#n229.19">19</a> into their mouths.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span></p>
<p>After another space of time had elapsed, something again said as it had said before:
“He-who-was-born-from-his-mother’s-side, are you awake? Do you not feel that the supernatural
beings, whom people are afraid even to think of, are coming together against you?”
Then he picked up his bow and ran out. Again there were ten canoes with red paintings
on their bows.
</p>
<p>Then he went to his grandfather. “They are coming after me by sea, grandfather.” “Stop!
brave man, what are the bows of their canoes like?” “They have red paintings upon
them.” Then he said to him: “Have the urine in this town gathered together and hot
stones put into it. Then have it spilled about in front of them.” And so he did. Those
were the sand fleas,<a class="noteRef" id="n230.22src" href="#n230.22">22</a> they say.
</p>
<p>By and by, something went along under his pillow, saying the same thing it had said
before, and he again laid hold of his bow. Again ten canoes with their bows painted
red were coming along.
</p>
<p>Then he started off to his grandfather. “They are coming against me by sea.” “What,
brave man, what do the bows of their canoes look like?” “The canoe bows have red paintings
on them.” “Do the same way you did when you destroyed the others.” Then he again spilled
urine around in front of them. Again their dead bodies lay around thickly. These were
the fleas,<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n230.22asrc" href="#n230.22">22</a> they say.
</p>
<p>And he again lay in bed. Something passed hurriedly under his pillow. “He-who-was-born-from-his-mother’s-side,
are you awake? Do you not feel that the supernatural beings, whom people do not even
like to think of, are assembled against you?” He quickly took his bow. He looked in
the direction from whence they had always come. Nothing was to be seen. Then he also
looked upward. There was nothing in sight. Then he looked toward the edges of the
sky. Lo! a great fire came toward him upon the surface of the ocean.<a class="noteRef" id="n230.23src" href="#n230.23">23</a>
</p>
<p>Then he went to the old man. “Grandfather, they are coming to me by sea.” “What do
the canoe bows look like?” “The edges of the sky come burning.” “Alas! Alas! I wonder
what will happen. Now, brave man, scatter the bones of the town people about in front
of the town and stand the sides and ends of the grave boxes on their edges in front
of the houses. People always endeavor to stop it that way, brave man.”
</p>
<p>And, after it had come along burning for a while, it came to the human bones. After
some time had passed it burned through. It burned through in another place. By and
by it came landward faster, without having been stopped. When it reached the sides
and ends of the grave boxes it stopped there also.
</p>
<p>He put on his five blankets and put his mother in his armpit. His wife he put in the
knot in his hair. Then he walked about behind [the boxes]. After some time those were
also thrown down by the fire. Immediately he started off.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>After he had gone toward the middle of this island for a while, something said to
him: “This way, grandson; my house is strong.” At once he turned thither. He entered
the house and sat down. While he sat there the noise of burning sounded on top of
his house. After a while a red hole was burned through the roof of his house. Then
they pulled him up. They struck him from behind with their fists. When he bent over
to go out one of his blankets was burned off. That was Fallen-tree-lying-with-one-end-in-the-water
whose house he was in.
</p>
<p>After he had gone on for a while [something said]: “This way, grandson; my house is
strong.” Then he entered and sat down. The roof of that was also burned through. Then
they pushed him out. When he was burned another blanket was burned off. That was Yellow-cedar’s
house, they say.
</p>
<p>After he had run for some time longer something else called to him, “This way, grandson;
my house is strong.” He entered and sat down. After it had burned on the roof of the
house for a while there was again a red hole there. Then they pushed him out. Another
one was lost. That was Yew’s house, they say.
</p>
<p>After he had run about something else called him in. “Come in, grandson; my house
is strong.” And he went in and sat down. After he had sat there a while there was
again a red hole in the house. Then they pushed him out. Another blanket was burned
off. This was Spruce’s<a class="noteRef" id="n231.24src" href="#n231.24">24</a> house, they say.
</p>
<p>And, after he had gone some time longer, something called him in. “This way, grandson;
my house is strong.” He entered and sat down. After he had sat there for a while there
was another red hole in the roof of the house. Then they drove him out with their
fists. When he bent down to go out, a blanket was burned off. His mother was also
burned away. That was Rock’s house, they say.
</p>
<p>And, after he had gone on a while longer, something else called him in, “This way,
grandson; my house is very strong.” Then he went in and sat down. The noise of fire
was heard on the roof for a while, and, when it stopped, he went out. That was Swamp’s
house, they say.
</p>
<p>After he had wandered about upon this island for a while he heard the sound of a hammer.
He went thither. Lo! an old man was repairing a canoe with cedar limbs. Where it had
not had a crack he split it with his wedge. He made holes about this with his gimlet
and sewed the place together again.
</p>
<p>After he had looked at him a while, he stole his gimlet and went under a clump of
ferns with it. Then the old man hunted for his gimlet. Then he put his finger nails
into his mouth. Presently he said: “Grandson, if it is you, come to me. News has come
about you that Burning-sky pursued you for your five blankets.”
</p>
<p>Then he went to him. He gave him his gimlet. It was old and <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>rotten, they say. Then he made one for him. He also gave him a whetstone. Then he
picked up two creeks near the town and told him to look on attentively. “Now, grandfather,
act as you are going to when common surface birds<a class="noteRef" id="n232.25src" href="#n232.25">25</a> get food for themselves.” Then he made him a beak out of the creeks. He also gave
him some feather clothing. And he said to him: “Now, grandfather, practice.”<a class="noteRef" id="n232.26src" href="#n232.26">26</a>
</p>
<p>So [Heron] flew away. He sat on a kelp floating about in front of the burned town.
After he had sat watching for a while he speared something with his beak. An eel was
moving in his mouth. He swallowed it. Then he flew away again and sat near the canoe.
</p>
<p>Then he said to him: “Now, grandson, come with me. Go out and look for your blankets
again. Those on the other side are not chiefs. Now, grandson, go and get the canoe.
You are going to see your blankets.” The old man got into the stern also, and they
went oceanward.
</p>
<p>They went, went, went a while and came to his town, to Burning-sky’s town. Then they
came down to meet him. Part of them also filled the house as if something had poured
into it. And they said to one another: “They say he has brought his nephew, Sandhill-crane,<a class="noteRef" id="n232.27src" href="#n232.27">27</a> to dance.”
</p>
<p>And he gave him these directions: “When I go in look toward the rear of the house.
After your poor nephew has danced go over and get your blankets. And you will also
get your mother neatly.”
</p>
<p>Then he landed. He went up. And he had a little box in his hand. He had a baton. When
he got inside, he stretched himself. Lo! his blankets were hung in the rear of the
house. His mother also sat in front of them. He sat down in the middle of the side
of the house. The house had ten rows of retaining timbers.
</p>
<p>Then he hunted in his small box. He took his nephew out of it, wā-ā-ā-ā-ā. And he
stood him up. He began dancing. He took the end of his wing in his mouth. After he
had moved backward a while, the people in the house [said] “S-s-s-s-s-s” [with pleasure].
Those on the top step went to sleep at the sight.
</p>
<p>After he had danced a while, he stuck his baton up, took [his nephew] and threw him
at it. At once he was a weasel<a class="noteRef" id="n232.28src" href="#n232.28">28</a> climbing up on it. Again they said “S-s-s-s-s-s.” The next row went to sleep.
</p>
<p>And he again picked him up and threw him at the baton. He became a woodpecker<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n232.12src" href="#n228.12">12</a> and climbed up it. Again those in the house said, “S-s-s-s-s-s.” The next row below
went to sleep.
</p>
<p>By and by he picked him up again. He threw him at it. He climbed up as a California
creeper.<a class="noteRef" id="n232.29src" href="#n232.29">29</a> Again [they said], “S-s-s-s-s-s.” Again [a row] went to sleep.
</p>
<p>Then he took his baton and put it back into the box. “Enough. I think he has danced
a long time.” He put him away. Then He-who-was-born-from-his-mother’s-side went to
the rear of the house, put on <span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>his blankets, and took his mother. Then the old man went out quickly. They got into
the canoe and went off.
</p>
<p>When they were halfway home it came burning after them again. When it got near, he
breathed toward it, and it stopped. Then they came home, and he went up.
</p>
<p>Again his five blankets were burned off, and his mother as well. He reached for his
wife. She, too, was gone. They took her away from him to marry her, they say.
</p>
<p>Then he wandered on aimlessly. After he had gone along a while he let himself fall
to the ground and wept. He looked toward the forest. All the trees wept with him.
Then he looked seaward. All the fishes beneath its surface wept with him. Now he had
his fill of crying and went on again.
</p>
<p>After he had wandered on for a while [he heard] some people laughing and talking.
And he went thither. They were trying to shoot leaves off of a big tree. As soon as
they had shot one down they ate it. When he got there they moved back from it. “He-who-was-born-from-his-mother’s-side
is going to shoot,” they said.
</p>
<p>Then he shot at it. He shot it near the base. It began to fall. He made the supernatural
beings rejoice by his shot. And he said, “Take care of its eggs (seeds). I will let
my cousin, Cloud-woman, take off the head [of seeds].”<a class="noteRef" id="n233.30src" href="#n233.30">30</a> That was tobacco, they say.
</p>
<p>Then they sent for her, and she came by canoe. She took all of its eggs. These she
began to plant. They were spread all over this island.
</p>
<p class="small">This short story is given as if it were a purely Haida myth, but from an abstract
of another version obtained in 1878 by Dr. G.&nbsp;M. Dawson it would seem possible that
it came originally from the mainland. The abstract referred to runs as follows:
</p>
<p class="small">“Long ago the Indians (first people or ancient people—thlin-thloo-hait) had no tobacco,
and one plant only existed, growing somewhere far inland in the interior of the Stickeen
country. This plant was caused to grow by the deity, and was like a tree, very large
and tall. With a bow and arrows a man shot at its summit, where the seed was, and
at last brought down one or two seeds, which he carried away, carefully preserved,
and sowed in the following spring. From the plants thus procured all the tobacco afterward
cultivated sprung.” (Dawson’s Report on the Queen Charlotte Islands, Montreal, 1880.)

<p class="first center">[Told by the Chief of Kloo of Those-born-at-Skedans]
</p>
<p>There lay Pebble-town.<a class="noteRef" id="n235.1src" href="#n235.1">1</a> At times the town people fished for herring with nets. Sometimes they got a porpoise
in their nets. And, when they reached home, the town chief sent a slave into the house
of him who had killed it and had him say: “The chief says you are not to spill the
blood of the porpoise upon the ground.”<a class="noteRef" id="n237.2src" href="#n237.2">2</a> In this way the porpoises were often taken away. The chief treated the town people
as if they were his slaves.
</p>
<p>And his nephew was a child. He saw that his uncles were treated like slaves. He saw
that, although they had been nearly starved for some time, the chief took away the
porpoises in the town from them. One day he and his grandmother went away. After they
had gone on for some time they arrived at Telel.<a class="noteRef" id="n237.3src" href="#n237.3">3</a>
</p>
<p>Then they built a house there. And there he began to bathe for strength. After he
had bathed for some time he became strong. Then he made a bow for himself. And he
shot a goose with his arrows. Then he skinned it and cut a hole on its under surface.
He put it on his head, and it fitted well. Then he dried it.
</p>
<p>The geese being plentiful on the water, he put his head into [the skin] and swam to
them. From beneath he pulled them under water. At once he twisted off their necks.
He did the same thing to their wings. Then he carried them to his grandmother, and
his grandmother plucked them. He at once dried them.
</p>
<p>And one time he punched his nose with broken pieces of basket work and let [the blood]
run upon these. He used them to bait his halibut hooks, and he took along wooden floats,
laid his halibut hooks upon them, and pushed them out into the sea. When they were
some distance out to sea, he jerked, the halibut hooks fell into the water, and he
pulled in halibut. He kept giving them to his grandmother.<a class="noteRef" id="n237.4src" href="#n237.4">4</a>
</p>
<p>And one day he went down the inlet in search of something. After he had gone on for
a while some creature wearing a broad, blue hat came to him. Then he asked him: “Where
did you come from?” He paid no attention to him. And again he asked him: “Where did
you come from?” Then he said to him: “[I came] From <span class="corr" id="xd32e24844" title="Source: Qꜝᴀ́kun">Qꜝᴀ′kun</span>.”<a class="noteRef" id="n237.5src" href="#n237.5">5</a>
</p>
<p>And he had two duck skins<a class="noteRef" id="n237.6src" href="#n237.6">6</a> on his back, one of which had the top of its head spotted with white. He seized one
of them. He did not know what happened to him. Lo! he came to himself lying upon the
edges of the retaining timbers in some house.
</p>
<p>Then some one in the house said concerning him: “Throw him out. <span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>Throw the thing he wants out along with him.” Then he again lost consciousness. When
he came to himself he was lying near the ocean. A whale lay near him.
</p>
<p>Then he cut it open, twisted a young tree, and fastened it to it. And he dragged it
along and brought it before his grandmother’s house, and his grandmother cut it up.
After she had cut it all up she steamed it. After she had got through hanging it up
he had his grandmother make a big basket. She finished it.
</p>
<p>Then she put the food into it. She put in all kinds of berries, salmon, roots,<a class="noteRef" id="n236.7src" href="#n236.7">7</a> and kinnikinic berries. And it was finished. Then he and his grandmother went up
the inlet. And he hid the basket near the town. Then he entered his uncles’ house.
</p>
<p>And, after his uncles had fished for herring for some time, they killed another porpoise.
Then a slave again came in and commanded that they should spill none of the blood.
Then [the chief] came in and seized it, and he carried it off. As he was going out
with it, he took it away. He became so angry where he sat in the rear of the house
that the floor planks were as if split into slivers by the finger nails.
</p>
<p>Then he pulled it away from him again. And, when he picked it up again, he let him
go outside with it. Then he twisted [the chief’s] neck round outside. And he said:
“Wā-ā-ā, wā-ā-ā.” When he came near the end of the town [he said]: “Wā-ā-ā, he has
killed me.” Then his voice was lost in the woods.
</p>
<p>Now he had a crowd of people go over for the basket. And they could not lift it. Then
he went to get it. And he brought it in. Then he began to call the people. Next day
he called the people again, and the day after.
</p>
<p>And he became town mother [instead of the old chief]. The one he sent off killed is
He-who-travels-behind-us.<a class="noteRef" id="n236.8src" href="#n236.8">8</a>
</p>
<p class="center">[Sequel to the above, told by Edward of the Food-giving-town people]
</p>
<p>Her brother (i.e., the old town-chief) was killed. Then she started from the town.
And she put the two bracelets she wore into the middle of ʟgidō′<a class="noteRef" id="n236.9src" href="#n236.9">9</a>. And she said: “Through you future people shall see a portent.” When something terrible
was going to happen, they saw them. Broad seaweeds lay upon them. They paddled off
in terror. Although they (the people) had before been living quietly, they moved from
that place at once. And she went up into the woods opposite. She became a mountain
there. They call it Sea-otter-woman.
</p>
<p id="ch3.7.n" class="small">This is also one of the most esteemed Haida myths. The version here presented was
obtained from the present chief of Kloo with the exception of the portion about Sea-otter-woman,
which was contributed by an old man of the nearly extinct Daiyū′­ał-lā′nas or People
of Skidegate creek. Qonā′ts, the hero of the story, was one of the Sea-otters (Qogā′ñas),
and, were any of those people still living, a much longer version might perhaps have
been secured.

<p class="first center">[Told by Walter McGregor of the Sealion-town people]
</p>
<p>At White-slope<a class="noteRef" id="n238.1src" href="#n238.1">1</a> a certain person and his mother were disliked. They made a house out of branches
at one end of the town in which they lived. When it was low tide he went down and
brought up something for his mother to eat.
</p>
<p>After he had done this for some time he came to a heron with a broken bill. Then he
sharpened it. And it said to him: “Grandson, you helped<a class="noteRef" id="n238.2src" href="#n238.2">2</a> me nicely. I will also help<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n238.2asrc" href="#n238.2">2</a> you. Keep this medicine in your mouth.” Then it also gave him the feather on the
tip of its wing, and it said to him: “Blow this under the armpit of the son of the
town chief. Even the supernatural beings will not know it.”
</p>
<p>The child often played at having supernatural power. He had a mat as a dancing skirt.
He fastened shells upon it. Others he used as a rattle. He had feathers he found as
a dancing hat. He used old cedar bark as a drum. One evening he went around the town.
He looked into some of the houses. A chief’s son sat in one of them. Then he pushed
the feather in between the side planks. When the point was turned toward his armpit,
he blew it in. As soon as it went into the chief’s son’s armpit, he had a pain.
</p>
<p>Then he went home. They got a shaman for [the chief’s son]. He went over to see him
practice. Some persons with black skins on the side toward the door held burning pitchwood.
Then he thought: “I wonder why they do not see the thing sticking out of him.” They
dropped their torches and ran out after him. He ran from them. Those were The-ones-who-have-spines-for-earrings.<a class="noteRef" id="n238.3src" href="#n238.3">3</a>
</p>
<p>The day after he went again. He wanted to see the shaman. When he thought the same
thing as he had thought before they ran out after him again. At that time they discovered
that it was the boy.
</p>
<p>Then they set out to get him. He spit medicine upon the things he had been playing
with.<a class="noteRef" id="n238.4src" href="#n238.4">4</a> The dancing skirt had a drawing on it. The drum had the picture of a wā′sg̣o. The
dancing hat, too, was finished.
</p>
<p>They hung up five moose skins for him. He went thither, and the beating plank beat
itself as it came in. They had opened the door for him. While they were looking through
it for him, his dancing hat came out back of the fire.<a class="noteRef" id="n238.5src" href="#n238.5">5</a> It did the same thing on the other side, on the side toward the door, and on the
opposite side. After it had come up in all four corners he stood up. He took his feather.
When he pulled it out the pain ceased, and the sickness was gone. Just before <span class="pageNum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>he went out he blew it in again. He did not think he had received enough. Then he
went away.
</p>
<p>Next day they made the number of his moose skins ten, and he again went there. Again
the drum and the beating board went in of themselves. After he had entered as before
he stood up. After he had danced around for a while he pulled his feather out for
good. The chief’s child slept.
</p>
<p>He had many uncles. They kept their daughters for him. Among these one was short on
one side. That was the youngest’s daughter. One time, when they were going on a picnic,
he started. And he changed himself into a salmon-berry bush near the trail and waited
there.
</p>
<p>When the lame one came along behind he tangled himself up in her hair. While she was
trying to untie it, all left her. Instead, he came and stood near her. Then he said
to her: “I will marry you. Go with me.” Then she went with him. After he had entered
the house with her he spit medicine on her. He stretched her leg out. It became well.
He married her.
</p>
<p>Then he threw away the house of branches and built a regular house for himself. He
made a bedstead which he and his wife always used. One night, while he slept, the
house moved with him, and he awoke. He heard some one talking with his mother. When
day broke he opened his eyes. Something wonderful lay there into which he awoke. The
carvings inside of the house winked their eyes. The carvings on the corner posts of
the bedstead moved their tongues at each other. In a rear corner of the house something
stood making a noise. That was Greatest Hopper,<a class="noteRef" id="n239.6src" href="#n239.6">6</a> they say. Master Carpenter<a class="noteRef" id="n239.7src" href="#n239.7">7</a> had <span class="corr" id="xd32e24957" title="Source: became">become</span> his father, they say.
</p>
<p>When he arose [the latter] said: “Come! my child, let me fix you up.” Then he went
to him. He combed his hair. It hung down broad and glossy even beyond his buttocks.
He painted his face. He was very handsome.
</p>
<p>After he had lived a while with his father in that house he set out to marry the daughter
of Many-ledges. Then his father told him that he destroyed the sons of the supernatural
beings. And he let him take his arrows. “They fly around,”<a class="noteRef" id="n239.8src" href="#n239.8">8</a> he said to him. One bore the figure of a weasel. The other bore the figure of a mouse.
He also gave him some knots. “In his town driftwood never floats ashore,” he said
to him.
</p>
<p>He had Greatest Hopper take him over. After he had gone along for a while with him
the capes before him were burning. Then he spit medicine upon them, and he hopped
quickly over with him. When he got close in front of Mā′g̣ᴀn<a class="noteRef" id="n239.9src" href="#n239.9">9</a> he felt extremely sweet. There were very many stick-potatoes there. That made him
so, they say. After <span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>he had brought him to the end of Many-ledges’ town, Greatest Hopper went back.
</p>
<p>Then he changed himself into knots and at evening floated ashore in front of the town,
awaiting until his children came down to defecate. By and by they came down. “See
the driftwood which has floated ashore. It is wonderful, because driftwood never floats
ashore in father’s village.” Then they picked it up and laid it down near the door.
Then they forgot it.
</p>
<p>And, when they were going to bed, they thought of it and brought it in. He (Many-ledges)
started to cut it up with one of his five stone adzes. It broke. Then he took another.
He struck it with that, too. That, too, broke. After the same thing had happened to
four, he split it in pieces with the last one. Then he was glad. And he put it into
the fire.
</p>
<p>When the daughters went to bed he shot in as a spark. Then he sat at the head of the
bed and laid his hands on them. “Who are you?” [they said]. And he said, “It is I.”
“Who is I?” “I am He-who-got-supernatural-power-from-his-little-finger.” When he was
a boy and was whittling, something stuck into his little finger.<a class="noteRef" id="n240.10src" href="#n240.10">10</a> That is why he was so called. Then the woman<a class="noteRef" id="n240.11src" href="#n240.11">11</a> said: “For him alone my father has kept me.”
</p>
<p>And, when she replied to him, he married her. When day broke her father said: “I wonder
what supernatural being was talking to my daughter last night. I had her for He-who-got-supernatural-power-from-his-little-finger.”
Then she said to her father: “Father, he is the one, he says.”
</p>
<p>“Now, my child, come down and sit by the fire with your husband.” And they came down
and sat there. They spread out a mat for him, and he gave him food. They brought out
berries and grease. Flames came out of them. They put some into a tray and set it
before him. The woman told him not to eat it. After he had swallowed medicine four
times he took some. When he had taken two mouthfuls he stopped. It passed quickly
through his insides burning. He stood up and, where he had sat, smoke rose.
</p>
<p>Next day he said to his daughter: “Let your husband go and get an alder for me which
stands behind the house.” And he got up quickly. Then she clung to her husband crying.
“Alas! the supernatural beings think they can do everything. They have me marry their
sons. By and by he begins to do this way.” Then he said to his wife: “Let me go. I
will see what he is going to do to me.” And she said to her husband: “Go to it after
it has come together and lightning has flashed in it four times.”
</p>
<p>Then his father-in-law gave him a stone wedge, and he went along a trail running inland
side of the house. After he had gone in some distance [he saw] it standing far off.
After it had come together and <span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>lightning had shot in it four times he spit medicine before him and went to it. After
he had chopped at it a while and it had fallen, he found himself inside of its mouth
(lit.). There was no way to get out. Something held him tight.
</p>
<p>Then his father’s supernatural powers came to him. Four having their hair tied in
bunches with cedar limbs came quickly to him. Two had wedges in their hands. Two had
big hammers. Then they worked at the alder, and they split it. They pulled him out.
He rubbed medicine upon himself and became as he had been before.
</p>
<p>When he pulled it apart human bones burst out of it. Some of these were like whole
human bodies; some were just held together by the ligaments. Then he trod the alder
into bits and threw them around. “Those will be useful to the very last people.” Then
he carried half of it off on his shoulder, let one end down on the ground in front
of the house, and struck the house front hard. Then his father-in-law said: “Alas!
he has killed my supernatural helper.” Then he went in and lay by his wife behind
the screens. His father-in-law had the fire quenched, they say.<a class="noteRef" id="n241.12src" href="#n241.12">12</a>
</p>
<p>Next day he again said to his daughter, “Come, my child, let your husband go for a
small devilfish of mine which lives toward the point.” Then he again got up quickly.
Again his wife clung to him. And his wife said: “They let me marry the sons of the
supernatural beings who think themselves powerful. By and by he begins to do this
way.” Then he said to his wife: “Let me go. I will see the thing he uses against me.”
Then she gave her husband directions. “After it has spit upward and it has lightened
four times go to it.”
</p>
<p>Then he went to it. He shot it twice with the arrows his father had given to him.
After it had shot up water four times he spit medicine in front of himself and went
to it. After he had struck it with a stick<a class="noteRef" id="n241.13src" href="#n241.13">13</a> he was in its mouth.
</p>
<p>When he was almost drowned in its slime he thought of his father’s supernatural helpers.
Again the four came to him. They had clubs in their hands, and they clubbed it in
the eyes. They pulled him out. He was covered with slime. Then he spit medicine upon
himself. He became as he had been before. The bones in it were also many.
</p>
<p>He pulled it apart and tore half of it in pieces and threw them around. “These will
be useful to all future people.” And he carried half of it off with a stick. He threw
it in on the side toward the door. Then his father-in-law said: “Alas! he has killed
my supernatural helper.” Then he entered and lay behind the screens with his wife.
</p>
<p>Next day he again said to his daughter: “Come! my child, let your husband go after
my little sea lion yonder.” At once he got up. Again she clung to her husband while
she cried. “He always lets them marry the sons of the supernatural beings who think
they are strong<span class="corr" id="xd32e25007" title="Not in source">.</span> <span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>By and by he begins to do this way.” Then he again said to his wife: “Let me go. I
will see the thing with which he is going to do [harm] to me.” And his wife gave him
directions. “After it has looked at you and growled four times go to it.”
</p>
<p>Then he started for it. He was going to kill it with a club which his father-in-law
gave him. After he had gone toward it for a while he saw it lying there. After it
had looked at him and growled four times he went to it. When he came near it it breathed
in. He went into its mouth.
</p>
<p>And again he thought of his father’s supernatural helpers. Again they came to him
bearing bone clubs. They clubbed the sea lion on the head. They killed it. When he
(the youth) was almost dead they pulled him out of its mouth. Then he put medicine
upon himself and was restored.
</p>
<p>Then he pulled the sea lion apart. The bones of three persons fell out of it. Then
he tore half of it in pieces and threw them around. “You will be useful to all future
people.” And he carried off half of the sea lion and threw it in through the doorway.
His father-in-law said: “Alas! he has killed my supernatural helper.” Then he lay
behind the screen again with his wife.
</p>
<p>Next day he again said to his daughter: “Come! my child, let your husband go for my
little hair seal yonder.” And at once he arose. Again his wife clung weeping to him.
“He always lets me marry the sons of the supernatural beings who think themselves
powerful. By and by he begins to treat them this way.” And he said to his wife: “Let
me go. I will see the thing with which he does it.” “After it growls and looks toward
you four times go to it,” she said to him.
</p>
<p>Then his father-in-law gave him a bone club, and he set out to it. After he reached
it, and the hair seal had looked at him and growled four times he went thither, and
it breathed in. He was in its mouth.
</p>
<p>Again he thought of his father’s supernatural helpers, and again they came to him
bearing bone clubs. They struck the hair seal on the head and killed it. Then they
pulled him out, and he rubbed medicine upon himself.
</p>
<p>Then he pulled the hair seal apart. Half of the hair seal he pulled in pieces and
scattered around. “This will be useful to all future people.” Out of this, also, poured
the bones of two persons. Then he carried off half of the hair seal upon his shoulder
and threw it down in the house. His father-in-law said: “Alas! he has killed my supernatural
helper.” Again he lay with his wife behind the screens.
</p>
<p>The day after that he said to his daughter: “Come! let your husband go and get my
little eagle sitting yonder.” Again she did not want her husband to go, and he said
to his wife: “Let me go as before. I will see the thing with which he is going to
do it to me.” Then she said to her husband: “Go to it after its eye mucus has dropped
four times.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he took his arrows. His father-in-law said that they pushed the eagle down with
a pole. Then he went thither. After its eye mucus had dropped four times he shot it
up through the belly. He went to the other side also and shot it from that side as
well. But it did not do anything, they say.
</p>
<p>Then he scattered half of it around. “All future people will make use of you.” And
he carried half of it off on his shoulders. The bones of two persons came out. Then
he threw it into the house. His father-in-law said: “Alas! he has killed my supernatural
helper.” And again he lay with his wife.
</p>
<p>Next day he said to his daughter as before: “Come! my child, let your husband go and
get my little clam on the point.” And again she went to her husband. Still he started
thither. And she gave her husband directions: “Go to it after it has spit out water
four times.” And his father-in-law said: “They get it by means of a stick.”
</p>
<p>Then he gave him a digging stick, and he went thither. After it had spit up water
four times, he went to it and started to get it with a stick; he suddenly found himself
in its mouth.
</p>
<p>When he thought of his father’s supernatural helpers, they came to him holding flat,
broad clubs. They struck on its ligaments (lit., “eyes”),<a class="noteRef" id="n243.14src" href="#n243.14">14</a> and they pulled him out. Then he scattered half of it around. “All future people
will make use of these,” he said. He took half of it, went home with it, and threw
it down in the house. “Alas! he has killed my supernatural helper.” Again he lay with
his wife.
</p>
<p>The day after that he had a fire lighted. They rubbed hard, white stones together,
and it burned.<a class="noteRef" id="n243.15src" href="#n243.15">15</a> He told them to put stones into it. At once they did so. When they became hot they
put them into a stone box lying near the door. Then his father-in-law told him to
get in. At once he stood up and, after he had spit medicine upon himself four times,
he sat in it. It was cold.
</p>
<p>Then they put the box cover over it. After he had sat there for a while he tapped
upon the side of it. Then he (his father-in-law) made a noise at him with his lips.
He said: “I guess I have killed him.”
</p>
<p>By and by he stood up, throwing his hair back out of it. And he kicked the box to
pieces and threw the pieces around the side of the house toward the door. His father-in-law
became ashamed. He had destroyed his ten supernatural helpers. After that his mind
became good toward him.<a class="noteRef" id="n243.16src" href="#n243.16">16</a>
</p>
<p>The devilfish he killed was in the cave at Skedans point, they say. And his father-in-law,
Many-ledges, was a cliff behind the town of Skedans.
</p>
<p>His mind had become changed toward him. After he had stayed with his wife for a while
he told his wife he wanted to return home. Then she told her father, and her father
said: “Now, my child, go <span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>with your husband. Just outside is a canoe.” Then her husband went out. There lay
an old canoe out from between the cracks of which grass was growing.
</p>
<p>Then he went in and told his wife, and she said to her father: “Father, he hunted
in vain for the canoe. He says there is only an old one there.” “That is it.” Then
she went to it with her husband. She kicked it on the edges and [said]: “Go seaward,
father’s canoe.” At once it was floating there. It went of itself either way. The
carving on the bow paddled. Then he told it to come near. It came before him.
</p>
<p>And he had his daughter take along all kinds of food. There was a great quantity of
it. He sent five slaves to take care of the canoe. He had five boxes of berries and
grease put in for the canoe. And he said to his daughter: “My child, when it is hungry
it will point its bow backward. Then let your husband throw one box at its face.”
</p>
<p>Then they started. He sat high in the bow with his wife, and the bow carving paddled
the canoe. After it had gone along for some time the canoe turned its bow back. Then
they pulled out one of the boxes of grease and berries, and he threw it at its face.
Again it went on. After it had gone along for a while the canoe turned its bow back
again, and again he threw the grease and berries at its face with a spoon. Then the
canoe again went on.<a class="noteRef" id="n244.17src" href="#n244.17">17</a>
</p>
<p>After they had gone on a while longer they saw the town. The whole town was alight
with fires. They wanted to see the daughter of Many-ledges. They asked: “Who is it?”
“It is He-who-got-supernatural-power-from-his-little-finger coming with his wife.”
</p>
<p>And they came down in a great crowd to the shore opposite. He came ashore, and they
took the food off. Then the five canoe slaves went back. They took along the three
boxes of berries and grease which were left for the canoe.
</p>
<p>Then his wife sat among the things, and he went up to the house and told his mother
to call her up. Immediately his mother went down. She saw nothing there. There was
only a cloud among the boxes. Then she went up and said to her son: “I saw nothing
there. Only a cloud was there resting upon the things.” He said to his mother: “That
is she.”
</p>
<p>Again she went down, and she called her up. The cloud came up after her. The cloud
went near the place where her husband sat. They wanted to see her. A great crowd awaited
her. By and by he said to his wife: “Take off your hat.” Then she told her husband
to take it off, and he took it off. He put it behind himself. There the cloud lay.
A wonderful creature sat where it had been. She was pretty, like a daughter of the
supernatural beings. The ones they had wanted him to marry looked in at her and wept
as they did so.
</p>
<p>And, after he had had his wife for a while, a whitish sea otter came <span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>swimming in front of the town. After they had shot at it for a while he also launched
his canoe. He shot at it with his arrows. He shot it in the end of the tail.<a class="noteRef" id="n245.18src" href="#n245.18">18</a> After it had flopped about there for some time he got it into his canoe. He came
home. Then he skinned it.
</p>
<p>There were spots of blood upon it. On account of these his wife washed it. After she
had done this for a while she slipped seaward upon it. When the water was as high
as her knees a killer whale went away with her blowing. She was stuck between its
fins. Killer whales went out to sea with her in a crowd.
</p>
<p>He got into a canoe and went after his wife. They disappeared under the water in front
of him. Then he came back and went crying around the town. By and by he questioned
an old man who lived at one end of the town. “What supernatural being is it that took
away my wife?” he asked of him. “Supernatural-being-always-in-the-cradle took your
wife away.”
</p>
<p>Then he gave him all sorts of things. He gave him all kinds of things that would be
useful to him. “Now, chief, I will let you have my canoe. I will go with you. I will
stand at the end of the trail, and you shall get your wife,” he said to him.
</p>
<p>He lent him his short canoe which lay outside. “Raise it, chief. Burn the bottom of
it. Take twisted cedar limbs, Indian tobacco, and tallow.” Then he did as directed.
</p>
<p>When it was a fine day he went to him, but he said it was a bad day. One day, when
it was cloudy, he went to him not expecting anything. He sat outside with his mat
over his shoulder. He also had on his hat. “It is a good day, chief. When we come
to the middle of the sea the sunshine will be upon us only.” Then he launched the
canoe. He got in the stern of his canoe. Immediately they set off.
</p>
<p>After they had gone on for a while the sunshine came out, as he had said. Then the
old man said to him: “Look for a kelp with two heads.” And they came to one. “Now
fasten [the canoe and leave] me right here. This is his trail.”
</p>
<p>Then he gave him directions. “Right in the trail at the end of the town Heron always
repairs a canoe. He never lets a strange supernatural being pass in. When he shouts,
quickly put Indian tobacco into his mouth. Also give him twisted cedar limbs. Then
he will conceal you.”
</p>
<p>And he went down upon the kelp. He went along for a while upon a trail in which were
footprints and heard the sound of a hammer. And he came to him. After he had looked
at him for a while he shouted. Then he put tobacco into his mouth. He also gave him
twisted cedar branches. Now he put him into his mouth.
</p>
<p>Then the town people came to him in a crowd. “Why did you shout like that?” “I cried
out because my awl slipped.” Then they <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>said to him: “No; you smell of human beings.” They hunted about him. They did not
find him. They went home from him.
</p>
<p>Then he took him out and gave him directions. “Supernatural-being-always-in-the-cradle
took your wife. His three-headed house pole<a class="noteRef" id="n246.19src" href="#n246.19">19</a> is always on the watch. Hide yourself from it. Did you bring tallow?” And he said
to him “Yes.” “Two persons covered with sores will come to get wood. Make their skins
well. Rub the tallow on them.”
</p>
<p>He went back of the houses. After he had sat there for a while they came to him. They
called out to him. “Do not tickle us by looking at us,” said they to him, and they
told him to come out to them. Then he went to them. And he rubbed the tallow upon
them and healed their scabs.
</p>
<p>Then they said to him: “To-day they are going to put fins upon your wife. That is
why we came after firewood. When it is evening, and we go after water we will cause
the strings of our buckets to break. We will let the water run into the fire. Go and
get your wife quickly in the midst of the steam.<span class="corr" id="xd32e25091" title="Not in source">”</span> So they spoke to him.
</p>
<p>As soon as evening came they came after water with two large buckets. He met them
there, and they said to him: “Prepare yourself.” And, when they went in, he looked
through the doorway and saw that his wife had tears on her cheeks. They had Supernatural-being-always-in-a-cradle,
the one who married her, hung up as if in a cradle.
</p>
<p>When they got in near the fire, and on each side of it, with the water the bucket
strings were broken. While the house was filled with steam, he went in quickly and
got his wife. Then he put her under his arm and ran away with her. The house pole
heads shouted: “He-who-got-supernatural-power-from-his-little-finger has taken his
wife back.”
</p>
<p>At once they pursued him. They ran after him in a great crowd. Supernatural-being-always-in-the-cradle
ran after them crying. He came with his wife to the old man. Then he again put them
into his mouth. When the crowd came to him they asked him: “Old man, did not He-who-got-supernatural-power-from-his-little-finger
pass by upon this trail? He has taken his wife back.” Then he said: “I felt nothing.”
And they hunted about a little farther. When they found nothing they asked him again:
“Did not you feel anything upon it?” “No,” he said. Then they said to him: “You smell
of a human being.” And they pushed him down. They felt all over him. Then he said:
“You make me tired by your handling. You better stop searching me.” Then they went
home from him.
</p>
<p>And afterward he took them out. And he said: “Go along carefully with your wife upon
this trail.” Then they went along the trail. After they had gone along for a while
they came to the place <span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>where the old man was. They got in with him and started off. After they had gone on
a while longer he came with her to the town. He had got his wife back, and he stayed
there with her always.
</p>
<p>[The following excellent version of this story was obtained by Professor Boas from
Charlie Edenshaw, chief of the Stᴀ′stas, a Masset family.]
</p>
<p>In the village T’ī [on the west coast of Graham island] there was a boy who lived
with his grandmother. His parents were dead. While he was still living in his little
house with his grandmother, he used to make wands with a little shell knife. While
doing so he ran a splint under his finger nail, which made his finger swell to an
enormous size. Therefore he received the name Sʟᴇg̣otsg̣ā′noē.
</p>
<p>One day the boy met a crane whose beak was broken. He carved a new beak for him out
of wood. They were living in the last house of the village. He had ten uncles who
were all chiefs. One of his uncles had a boy who was sick all the time. Now, the boy
who had healed the crane, took a small mat, which he tied round his waist like a shaman’s
apron. He made a rattle of cockleshell and carved a shaman’s wand for his own use.
He tried to imitate the shamans who were trying to heal his cousin. One day the youth
went to his uncle’s house, which was full of people. He looked into it and saw a bone
sticking in his sick cousin’s side. A black man was standing on each side of the door.
They were the porpoises. The boy thought: “If I am able to remove that bone my cousin
will recover.” The two black men said at once: “This boy says a bone is in the sick
boy’s side, and that he is able to pull it out.” Then the people laughed at him, but
they allowed him to try. The crane had given him a shaman’s powers, although he did
not know it. Then he pulled out the bone, and his cousin arose, healed and well. Then
he put it back again, and he was sick again. Now the boy returned to his house. He
said to his grandmother: “I am able to save my cousin.” She struck him, saying: “Don’t
say so, else they will punish you.” But he was able to see the bone in his cousin’s
side, although nobody else was able to discover it.
</p>
<p>Now the chief sent for his nephew. One of his slaves went to call him. Then his grandmother
said: “Surely, the chief is going to kill us.” Then the boy took his mat apron, his
rattle, and his wand and went to his uncle’s house. There were many shamans inside.
He went around the fire, keeping the fireplace to his left. Then he pulled the bone
out of his cousin’s body, blew upon him, while the people were beating time, and the
sick boy recovered. Then he put it in again, and he felt sick again. The sick boy
said that he had felt better for a little while, but that he was sick again. The other
shamans tried again to cure him, but they were unable to do so. Then the sick boy
asked them to send once more for his cousin. They sent for him, and, when he came,
they offered him all kinds of property, but he refused it. <span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>But the two porpoises knew his thoughts, and said: “Lk·anqēosʼg̣a′noe (= Jumping-on-one-leg,
name of the poor boy) wishes to have the paraphernalia which his father wore when
dancing.” His uncle promised to give them to him. Then he pulled out the bone and
healed his cousin.
</p>
<p>Now he wore a beautiful apron instead of his mat apron; he used a wooden rattle instead
of his shell rattle, and a bone wand instead of his wooden wand. Now he was a great
shaman.
</p>
<p>After some time he heard about a great chief whose name was T’êckoa′nayē. He wished
to visit him. He had a beautiful daughter whom all the chiefs desired to marry, but
he did not accept them. He killed all her suitors. He invited them to a meal and made
them sit down near the fire. Then he put four stones into his fire, and, when they
were red-hot, he put them into a dish. Then he made them swallow the stones.
</p>
<p>Now, Sʟᴇg̣otsg̣ā′noē intended to marry this girl. Before he went there the crane visited
him. He gave him a medicine which caused water to gather in his mouth so that it cooled
the stones. When he reached the chief’s house he chewed this medicine and was able
to swallow the stones without any injury.
</p>
<p>He came to a place where there were rock slides all the time. Then he chewed a medicine
called xu′ntsd’ala, and he came to a place near Skidegate. Then he took his strap
of mountain-goat wool. He threw it over Skidegate straits and stepped across it, using
it as a bridge. Then he threw it down once more, and thus reached her house. He thought:
“I wish the girl would come outside to-night.”
</p>
<p>Then she went out of the house and sat down on the beach to defecate. The boy assumed
the shape of a burl, which lay on the beach in front of the house. The girl said to
her slave: “Carry the burl into the house,” because she wished her father to make
a hook from it. The slave carried it home and told the chief that his daughter wished
him to make a hook out of the wood. Then the chief asked for his ax, intending to
split the wood. When he hit it his ax broke. Then the chief was sad. He took another
ax, but it broke also. Then he threw the wood into the fire.
</p>
<p>In the evening the chief’s daughter retired to her room, which was separated from
the main room by a large plank. When the wood was burned the boy in the shape of ashes
flew into the girl’s room. There he assumed his human shape. She asked him: “Who are
you? I want to marry no one but Sʟᴇg̣otsg̣ā′noē.” Then he replied: “I am Sʟᴇg̣otsg̣ā′noē.”
Then she was glad and allowed him to lie down with her. They talked all night. Early
the next morning the chief rose. He spat and he thought: “Who is talking to my daughter?
I don’t want anyone to become my son-in-law except Sʟᴇg̣otsg̣ā′noē.” Then his daughter
shouted: “He has arrived!” Then the old chief was glad. <span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>He spread mats on the floor of the house and put four stones into the fire. When the
stones were hot he took a dish and ordered his slaves to put the stones into the dish.
They placed it before the young man, who sat down on the mat. Then the girl said:
“You always try to kill my suitors by means of the red-hot stones.” The youth chewed
the medicine which he had received from the crane and rubbed his body with it. Then
he took the stones up in a ladle and swallowed them one after the other. They fell
right through his body. The floor of the house was made of stone, and the stones broke
it. The young man was not dead. Then they fed him with salmon and berries.
</p>
<p>On the following day the chief said to his daughter: “There is a devilfish at the
point of land just beyond our village. I have tried often to kill it, but I can not
do so. Tell your husband to try to kill it.” The young man started in his canoe, and
reached the place where the devilfish was living. Four times he chewed his medicine
and rubbed it over his body. Then he threw his harpoon at the eye of the devilfish.
As soon as he had done so he fainted, and the monster swallowed him. But he was not
dead. He merely thought: “I wish your stomach would burst,” and at once the stomach
of the devilfish burst, and it was dead. The bones of many people were inside. They
dropped to the ground when the monster died. Those who had been killed recently were
still partly covered with flesh, while those who had been killed long ago were only
bones. He chewed some of his medicine and spat on the remains. Thus he resuscitated
them. He took the devilfish and carried it to his father-in-law. He threw it down
in front of the house. It was so heavy that the house almost fell down.
</p>
<p>On the following morning the chief said to his daughter: “There is a tree not far
from here. Let your husband go and fetch its bark.” The young man took his stone ax
and went to the tree. Then he saw that the bark was sliding up and down all the time.
Again he chewed his medicine. Then he spat at the tree three times. Now he struck
it with his ax. He fainted right away. When he recovered his senses he found that
he was inside the tree. Then he only thought: “I wish the tree would break.” At once
the tree burst, and with him the bones of many people which the tree had killed fell
to the ground. He resuscitated them. Then he took the bark and carried it to the house.
He threw it down in front of the house and almost destroyed it.
</p>
<p>Then his father-in-law was very sad because he could not overcome his son-in-law.
He did not speak a word. On the following day he said: “Go and cut some alder wood
for my fire.” He gave him an ax, and the young man went. As soon as he struck the
alder he fainted. When he recovered his senses he found that he was inside the tree.
Again he thought: “I wish the tree would burst,” and he himself and many people whom
it had killed came out of it. He <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>resuscitated them. Then he took one-half of the tree on his shoulder and carried it
home.
</p>
<p>On the following morning the chief said to his daughter: “Let your husband catch the
sea otter which lives not far from here.” He gave him a harpoon. Then the young man
went out. Soon he reached a cave in which the sea otter was living. He chewed the
medicine and rubbed his body four times. Then he threw his harpoon. He fainted right
away. When he recovered his senses he found that he was in the stomach of the sea
otter, and he only thought: “I wish it would burst,” and the sea otter’s stomach burst,
and with him the bones of many people dropped out, whom he resuscitated.
</p>
<p>The old chief had not been able to overcome Sʟᴇg̣otsg̣ā′noē. After a while the latter
became homesick. He lay down and did not say a word. Then the old chief asked his
daughter: “Why is your husband sad?” She replied: “He is homesick. He wishes to return
to Tʼī.” “Hm!” replied the chief. After a while he continued: “Take my large canoe
and accompany him to his home.” The young man went out to look for the canoe, but
he could not find it. He only saw an old rotten tree with long roots. When he returned
to the house, the old man asked: “Did you find my canoe?” “No,” the young man replied,
“we have only seen an old rotten tree.” “That’s it, that’s it!” said the old man.
They returned, but when they reached the place they could not find the canoe. They
saw nothing but an old rotten tree. They returned to the house; and, when they informed
the old chief that they had not been able to find the canoe, he told them: “When you
reach the tree again, say, ‘Go into the water.’ ” They turned back, and, on reaching
the tree, said: “Go into the water, canoe of my father.” At once it was transformed
into a large canoe. It was full of geese (x·īt) which were crying all the time. They
were the oarsmen. The old chief gave them vast quantities of provisions, and they
started, the geese paddling the canoe.
</p>
<p>During all this time the youth’s finger was very thick and sore. In the evening they
camped. While they were asleep a great many spirits which the crane had held captive
in his finger by means of sorcery escaped, killed his wife, and scattered over the
whole world. From that time the whole country of the Haida has been filled with spirits.
Then the boy said: “Future generations shall always see the spirits which were living
in my finger.” Sʟᴇg̣otsg̣ā′noē traveled on, and nobody knew what became of him. If
he had not visited the old chief, he (the latter) would still continue to kill people.
</p>
<p class="small">This is a popular story known both at Skidegate and Masset. A version obtained by
Professor Boas from Charlie Edenshaw at Masset is appended to the story I myself obtained.
It differs from that in several interesting particulars. That two such <span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>distant points as Masset and Skedans should be combined in one myth seems rather singular.
The Haida equivalent of He-who-got-supernatural-power-from-his-little-finger is Sʟō′g̣ot-sg̣ā′nag̣wa-i.

<p class="first center">[Told by Walter McGregor of the Sea-lion-town people]
</p>
<p>He and his wife were the only two in the town. An eel had destroyed the town people.
A big dog also stayed with them. Her husband went fishing and always stopped at a
fishing ground right in front of the town. In his absence his wife went digging spruce
roots, and the dog always went with her. When her husband came home she steamed a
lot of halibut for him, putting it in a big tray. And he sat above it. And, when he
began to eat, his wife looked toward the door. She was afraid to look at him. When
her husband went fishing again she did the same thing.
</p>
<p>One day, as she bent down to dig roots, something startled her by touching her buttocks.
She looked toward it. Lo! he (the dog) came to her, and she cried hard. And, when
her husband again came from fishing, she steamed food for him again, set it before
him, and turned round toward the door. Shortly she became pregnant.
</p>
<p>One day, while her husband was out fishing, she gave birth. She gave birth to a dog.
A second one came forth and another. It went on this way until there were nine. The
middle one always showed its teeth. That was the one that was going to be brave. The
youngest came forth with medicine in its mouth. Last of all a bitch came forth. Counting
that one there were ten.
</p>
<p>Then her heart was not strong enough to kill them, and she put grass into the cellar
and put them into it together. And, when her husband came home, she did not look as
if anything had happened. And next day, when her husband went fishing, she again went
to dig roots.
</p>
<p>As soon as she had gone out from the house, a noise arose inside of it. They were
wrestling with each other there. The bitch was talking. Then she went back. She peeped
in at the door. Upon a pole in the rear of the house hung their skins. In another
place they were playing with one another. And, when she made a noise with the door,
they quickly took down their clothing. In a short time they were lying near the fire
with their feet drawn together. Then she put them into the cellar again.
</p>
<p>And, when her husband came home, he asked her: “My child’s mother, what made the noise
in this town?” “The dog was playing. He was running over the floor planks.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p>Next day her husband again went fishing. Afterward she went after roots again. No
sooner had she got out than a noise arose inside of the house. At that time she did
not return so soon. Then she gathered a quantity of dry firewood and looked in again.
Again the skins hung upon the pole in the rear of the house. And, when she made a
noise with the door again, they went over quickly and pulled their skins down. They
lay around the fire. And again she put them into the cellar. When Łᴀguadjî′na came
home again he asked her: “My child’s mother, what made the noise in the town?” “The
dog was playing with himself and made a noise on the floor planks.”
</p>
<p>When he went fishing again, the dog lay on the opposite side of the fire. Then she
threw a stone at him and said to him: “Who does not get wood for the mother of his
children?” And he got up. He shook himself and went out. Then there was a noise behind
the house, and she looked at him between the house planks. One with a big knot of
hair which fell below his buttocks and a striped skin rolled the firewood about. After
the noise had gone on for a while outside, he came in. He shook himself and lay down
again on the opposite side of the fire.
</p>
<p>When her husband came home he asked her: “Where did that good firewood come from?”
“Why, that is [from a tree] which fell behind us and which I rolled out to an open
place.”
</p>
<p>Next day her husband went fishing again, and she went after roots. Just before she
went out, she put wood on the fire. Soon after she went out a noise arose in the house.
Then she crept quietly thither. She had shut the door to easily. When she looked in
[she saw that] the skins were again hung in the rear of the house. They were pushing
each other about.
</p>
<p>After she had looked for a while they pushed each other toward the corner, and she
ran in quickly. She gathered the skins together quickly and put them into the fire.
At once they burned up. Then they sat in a row on the other side from her. One among
them was a woman.
</p>
<p>Then she said to them: “My children, when your father comes home and eats, do not
look toward him. After he is through eating I will let you eat also. People never
look him in the face.”
</p>
<p>Then Sawałī′xa ran out. His father was fishing seaward. He said, “Hō hū′-u-u-u hū.<a class="noteRef" id="n253.1src" href="#n253.1">1</a>” The more his mother tried to stop him, the more he shouted. When he (her husband)
came home she again steamed food for him. After she had laid it before him she turned
her face from him toward the door. Before he had eaten Sawałī′xa arose, picked up
a fat piece from the edge of a split fish, and stood around eating it. After he had
finished it, he picked up another. When he had finished that as well he pushed away
the tray.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>And he called to his wife: “My child’s mother, bring my cape to me.” Then she brought
it to him, and he put it on. Then he called for the eldest: “Come here, my child,
while I sing a song for you.” Then he went to him. After he had sung for a while he
pulled him closer to his breast. He was as one who has gone to sleep. “My child is
asleep. Let me lay him down.”
</p>
<p>And he called for another. He also went to him, and, after he had sung for him for
a while, he pulled him close to himself. He acted like the other. “My child is asleep.”
</p>
<p>After he had done this for a while, he got through with eight. Then he called the
last one, who had medicine in his mouth. After he had sung to him for a while and
pulled him closer to himself, he spit the medicine upon his chest. Something sharp,
like glass, fell from him and stuck into the floor planks. Then he brought the back
of his cloak round in front. And, after he had sung for him again and pulled him closer
to himself, he again spat medicine upon his breast. From that also the needles fell
off.<a class="noteRef" id="n254.2src" href="#n254.2">2</a>
</p>
<p>Now he became angry with him, and he was pushing him toward his whetstone, which stood
on edge in the rear of the house pointing toward the fire. When he touched it, it
ground the skin off of his side. He put the medicine upon his palms and rubbed it
upon himself, and it became well. After they had wrestled for a while he threw his
father down there. It ground away, and he was ground to pieces. He killed his father
quickly.
</p>
<p>Then he went to his elder brothers, who were lying about, laid them together, and
spit medicine upon them. They all got up. [Each said] “I guess I must have been sleeping
here.” All got up, and they continued to live in that house.
</p>
<p>Their names are as follows: The eldest was called G̣osg̣aʟ̣ē′kꜝa; [the next] He-whose-skin-is-of-white-rock,
the next one, The-left-handed. He was a brave fellow. He who was full of mischief
was named Sawałī′xa, and one was called Łg̣añā′ʼo. He who had medicine in his mouth
was called ʟā′ga-na′qatî.<a class="noteRef" id="n254.3src" href="#n254.3">3</a>
</p>
<p>Then they asked their mother: “Say! mother, why is this town empty?” “My child, a
supernatural being at the south end of the island destroyed your uncles. Since then
it has remained this way.” Then they said to each other: “To-morrow we will go and
look at it.” And next day they went and looked at it. It lived in a cave. In front
of it was a pile of human bones. They looked and went away.
</p>
<p>Then they made something with which to kill it. All nine twisted cedar limbs. Afterward
they spliced them. And then they twisted them together. They made it long. It was
also stout. Next day they went to it. When they arrived they strangled their sister
and fastened her on the end of a pole. They used her as bait. They set <span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>the snare in front of its den. After they had held their sister in front of it for
a while, it came out, and they drew her out before it.
</p>
<p>When the snare was even with its middle they pulled it up. They also pulled in their
sister quickly and spit medicine upon her. At once their sister seized the end of
the rope. After they had pulled against it for a while and began to be pulled down
on top of each other the cord broke, and they fell backward in a heap. Then they went
home.
</p>
<p>And after they had thought for a while what they could use with which to catch it
they began digging roots. They traveled around upon the island of Gᴀsq<sup>o</sup>.<a class="noteRef" id="n255.4src" href="#n255.4">4</a> Upon it they got roots. And they also twisted those. When the rope was long, they
went to it again. They again used their sister as bait. Again they put the snare in
front of it. When it put its head through, they slipped the knot down to its middle.
Again they pulled their sister in quickly, again they spat medicine upon her, and
again she seized the end of the rope. After they had been pulled down many times,
as they held this, it broke, and they fell backward in a heap. Then they went away
again.
</p>
<p>And they took dry strings lying upon the beach. As they went around the island they
carried them along. After that they spliced them. At once they twisted them. When
it (the rope) became long, they went over there again. Again they used their sister
as bait. When that also broke, they gave it up. Nothing was left that they could use.
</p>
<p>And, after they had lived there for a while, a wren chirped in the corner of the house.
It said “Guda′dixa-i” (“sinews”).<a class="noteRef" id="n255.5src" href="#n255.5">5</a> Then they felt strange about what it said, and all made blunt-pointed arrows and
bows. Then they began traveling about upon the island. Each kept coming in with three
or four [wrens]. At once their sister pulled out the sinews, after which they twisted
them together. It was slender.
</p>
<p>When this was long they went to it again. They set the snare in front of it. Again
they used their sister as bait. When he again came out they slipped the knot over
him. They pulled their sister away quickly and spit medicine upon her. At once she
was pulling along with them. All pulled upon it. It stretched out smaller. But when
it touched the face of a rock, that fell over. They were saying: “Think yourself wren
sinews.”<a class="noteRef" id="n255.6src" href="#n255.6">6</a>
</p>
<p>After they had pulled at it for a while, something cracked at the bottom of the island,
and they pulled it up. They cut its belly open. They cut human bones out. Then they
laid the bones together. If one part were missing, they broke off pieces of old limbs
of trees and put them in instead. Immediately ʟā′ga-na′qatî spit upon it. And they
said to them: “Go to the places where you used to live.” They killed him, and they
went home. That was Supernatural-eel, they say.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span></p>
<p>And, after they had lived there for a while, their sister became menstruant for the
first time. By and by [they heard] some one talking to their sister. They did not
know who it was that talked. And again some one talked to their sister. Then they
put pitch on the mat. And again some one was talking with their sister. In the morning
they bathed in the sea.<a class="noteRef" id="n256.7src" href="#n256.7">7</a> When they came in from it, there were spots of pitch on the side of him who was mischievous.
Then they pushed him from one to another. They laughed at him.<a class="noteRef" id="n256.8src" href="#n256.8">8</a>
</p>
<p>Then their mother said to them: “I guess they are laughing because the Djugî′tg̣a’s
head is going to be hung up in front of their menstruant sister.”<a class="noteRef" id="n256.9src" href="#n256.9">9</a> At once they inquired of an old man who lived at one end of the town. They asked
about the thing their mother spoke of. And they gave him twisted cedar limbs. They
also gave him strong bones to make gimlets out of and Indian tobacco. He told them
where its place was. He told them that it slept there, and he said it was easy to
approach it.
</p>
<p>Immediately they borrowed a fast canoe. They borrowed Fast-rainbow-trout’s<a class="noteRef" id="n256.10src" href="#n256.10">10</a> canoe. Then he stood in the middle, and, when they paddled all together, he shot
an arrow [forward]. It fell into the water abreast of the middle of the canoe. Then
they also borrowed Steel-head’s canoe, and, as he shot an arrow, they paddled. It
fell near the stern of the canoe. But still they did not think it was fast enough.
</p>
<p>Then they also borrowed Jellyfish’s canoe. It had a stern at each end. They could
pull it either way. It was not good looking. But they borrowed it. He said: “I will
go along with you.” They burned the bottom of it. Then they put it into the water.
One stood in the middle and he (the jellyfish) stuck in his tentacles far off. When
they used their paddles he shot an arrow. It fell far back in their wake.
</p>
<p>Then they pulled it up and prepared to go in it. Presently, when it was smooth at
sea, they went to the old man. He was Heron, they say. “It is a fine day” [they said].
And he said to them: “No, brave men, it is a bad day.”
</p>
<p>By and by there was a foggy morning. The mist was falling on the water. Then he went
to them. He sat outside. “Launch your canoe. It is a fine day. At noon the mist will
melt away under the sunshine.” Then he gave them directions. “When it sleeps phosphorescent
light shines in its eyes. Then go to it. When there is no phosphorescent light in
its eyes do not go to it.”
</p>
<p>Then they started off. After they had gone along for a while [they] saw the phosphorescent
light in its eyes. They had blue hellebore and urine, which they had let rot, in their
canoe. They took its hair into their canoe noiselessly. Presently they cut off its
head and put it in.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span></p>
<p>Jellyfish stuck his tentacles into the land. Their paddles they also plied together.
Under their bow the current flowed so fast as to make cracks [in the sea]. Into it
they poured the blue hellebore and urine. On the other side the current also cracked
itself by its passage. They treated that in the same way. At once they were in front
of the town. In a short time they had hung its head up in front of their sister. Long
hair hung down from it.
</p>
<p>Next day some one came singing out of the ocean.<a class="noteRef" id="n257.11src" href="#n257.11">11</a> He had a cane. It was red. He came in front of the town and stood there. “Give me
my son’s head or I will tip over your town,” he said.<a class="noteRef" id="n257.12src" href="#n257.12">12</a> Then two ran quickly over to the old man. “Old man, what shall we do? He says he
will upset the town.” “After you have gone to the end of the town, cover it with hard
white stones. Cover it from bottom to top.” Immediately they ran over and did so.
And again he said: “Give me my son’s head or I will upset the town.” Then Sawałī′xa
said: “Tip it over.” He struck the end of the town with the red thing he held. Instead
of falling it sounded like a drum. He struck it in front and from above. But it only
sounded like a drum. Then he gave it up and went out to sea. He vanished into the
ocean.
</p>
<p>Next day he again came singing some songs. After him came a crowd of red things. Those
were fleas, they say. Then they went quickly to the old man and asked him: “What shall
we do?” “Steam urine and pour it out toward them.” Then they did as he said. “Give
me my son’s head.” Then the fleas came toward the house, and they poured urine around
upon them. After they had killed half of them he again started seaward. He disappeared
into the ocean.
</p>
<p>Next day he came again. He carried his staff. Some objects flew in a crowd after him.
Those were sīxasʟtꜝᴀ′lgaña,<a class="noteRef" id="n257.13src" href="#n257.13">13</a> they say. Again they inquired of the old man, and he told them to make blunt arrows.
And they did as directed. When he had said “Give me my son’s head,” they came quickly
to the houses. Then they went out to them and shot them. After they had destroyed
half of those also he went off.
</p>
<p>The day after this he again sang some songs. Behind him the surface of the ocean came
burning. At this time they again ran over to the old man. He said to them (lit. “him”):
“Now, brave men, nothing at all can be done. Save yourselves by flight.” At once they
fled away with his head. The land burned after them. When one of them was burned up,
he threw it to another. This went on until only he who had medicine in his mouth was
left. When his side was partly burned he rubbed the medicine upon it, and it became
as it had been before. By and by he threw it (the head) into the fire. It stopped
there and went back.
</p>
<p>Afterward he started along. He hunted where his brothers had been burned. There was
not a sign of their bones there. After he <span class="pageNum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>had gone on for a while he called to the one who was mischievous “Sawałī′hū′⁺.” “Here.”
And where it sounded he went. Their bones lay there all together. Then he spit medicine
upon them. They got up. Each said: “I guess I must have slept a long time.” Then they
went seaward toward the open ground again.
</p>
<p>And they rebuilt their house, which was all burned. They restored their mother and
their sister, and again they began living there.
</p>
<p>One time [they heard] some one talking to their sister. He was lying with her in the
morning. That was North, they say. When he warmed himself before the fire he warmed
only his side. And the one who was full of mischief was surprised at it and began
making shavings. He dried them. He whittled up pitchwood among them. He put it with
the rest.
</p>
<p>One day, very early, his brother-in-law warmed himself. He stretched his blanket over
the fire. Then he also reached over the fire and threw the shavings into it. When
it blazed up, he threw himself backward. Lo! his penis struck upon his belly. Then
they laughed at him. And he said to them: “You are laughing at me. You will indeed
stand against me.”<a class="noteRef" id="n258.14src" href="#n258.14">14</a> And next day he went off.
</p>
<p>Then he hung blackly about the head of the Stikine river. Snow fell from him. Then
one went out to look. He was lost. Then another went to look, and he, too, was lost.
It went on in this way until all of them had disappeared. Only he who had medicine
in his mouth was saved. Then he also went to look.
</p>
<p>As he went he saw that his elder brothers had been frozen to death. He, too, got stuck
on freezing ice but spit medicine upon himself, and the ice fell from him. He made
straight for the black place in the sky. And he arrived. Out of his (North’s) anus
ice hung. He wet the points of his arrows with medicine and shot the ice. He ran away,
and ice fell in the place where he had been. He did the same thing again. Then he
went away.
</p>
<p>As he went along he spit medicine upon his elder brothers who had been frozen in their
tracks. At once they walked along with him. All went along together.
</p>
<p>And, after they had gone along for a while, they came to where a certain person lived.
He gave them food, as was usual, and they slept there that night. Then Sawałī′xa remained
awake. The one to whom they had come in lay in a corner. He got up, tied fine cedar
bark upon the end of a stick which hung above him, and let them breathe on it. Then
he went out with it, and Sawałī′xa went out after him. Near a rill of water was a
piece of cedar full of holes, out of one of which he pulled a plug. Into it he pushed
the cedar bark. Sawałī′xa was looking at him. And before him he came in, and he pretended
to be asleep. Presently he also came in.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he, in turn, put the cedar bark to his breath. And he went out, and Sawałī′xa
pulled out the thing that had been stuck in and pushed his in. Then he went to bed.
The next day, after he had given them some food, he took a bath. Afterward he became
sick. He said that his back and his head were sick. “I must have done it to myself.”
Presently he was dead. That was Greatest Wizard, they say. Then they went off. They
came to their house.
</p>
<p>By and by they started traveling again. They hunted birds. Then one disappeared. It
went on that way until all were gone. He who had medicine in his mouth let himself
be last. He followed the footprints of his elder brothers. When he saw his elder brothers
sitting upon a broad stump he did not feel how he got there, but he was sitting among
them.
</p>
<p>Then they broke their bows and arrows in pieces on top of it, and they built a fire.
And, after they had put them into it, they lay at once on the level ground below.
Then they also put themselves into it and stood below.<a class="noteRef" id="n259.15src" href="#n259.15">15</a> It was North who did this to them. Then they went home. They came to their house.
</p>
<p>When they had traveled about a while after that they found a mountain of ground hogs.
They built a house there and made dead falls<a class="noteRef" id="n259.16src" href="#n259.16">16</a> for them. When cold weather began to come on they came out. They made trousers out
of ground-hog skins.
</p>
<p>And, after they got back there, the next to the youngest could not catch any ground
hogs in his dead falls. He did not kill even one. And, when they went home, he refused
to go. Each gave him two. He refused them. Each offered to give him five. He also
refused those. Then they left him.
</p>
<p>After he had lived there for a while a woman came to him one night and lay down, and
he married her. Then she asked him why he did not succeed in taking them in dead falls,
and he said to her: “I could in no way get them.” “To-morrow make ten” [she said].
And next day he did as he was directed. The day after he went out to look at them.
Ten ground hogs were in them.
</p>
<p>And, after he had done this for a while, he had many, and early one morning he went
to see them. Then a whitish one went in before him. His wife told him not to put a
dead fall near it. Then he longed for it and set one in front of it. The very next
day it fell on it. And he feared his wife and hung it on the outside of the house.
</p>
<p>But, even from where his wife sat, [she said]: “My mother says, ‘Alas! my child.’ ”
At once she started off. He tried to hold his wife. He could not. When she got to
the door she said: “Come to life again.” Immediately they began running off in a crowd.
He tried to club them, and he tried to stop them at the door. He could not accomplish
that, either. Then he went along among them. After <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>he had followed his wife along he went in at the same place where she went in.
</p>
<p>Then he stayed with his wife there again. They brought in all kinds of things, among
them <span lang="hax">łkꜝiê′nkunᴀn</span>.<a class="noteRef" id="n260.17src" href="#n260.17">17</a> And, after it began to snow, they went to bed. After they had lain in bed for a long
time day came. He stood at the door outside and shouted “Daylight⁺.” They jumped up
without the things they used for blankets. “What is it daylight from? Is it daylight
from the <span lang="hax">łkꜝiê′nkunᴀn</span>?”<a class="noteRef" id="n260.18src" href="#n260.18">18</a> they asked each other. They looked at the snow and went to bed again. After he had
said this twice he gave it up and went to bed also.
</p>
<p>By and by, when the snow melted, they put on their skins, and they began bringing
in roots. He, also, went with them. Presently one called out “People are coming,”
and they went into the house.
</p>
<p>Again they (his brothers) set dead falls. The posts for these dead falls had figures
of ground hogs upon them. They only saw the shadow of the hands [setting them]. The
figures were to call them. One went thither and was caught. They pulled him out. The
ground hog looked out of the house. He almost went to it. His wife held him back.
</p>
<p>By and by he went thither, and it fell on him. Then they brought him into the house
and hung him up. And after they had begun to skin him and had cut his neck open they
struck something hard. And. when they looked, lo! it was the copper from around the
neck of the younger brother they had left.<a class="noteRef" id="n260.19src" href="#n260.19">19</a> Then they told each other, and they put his clothing upon him, and, after they had
spit the medicine upon him, he got up. He got up, saying: “I must have slept a long
time.” His elder brothers were glad to see him. And they started home with him. Anew
they began living in their house.
</p>
<p>And, after they had again traveled about for a while, the eldest again disappeared.
Next day another was gone. One went after him, and he, too, vanished. By and by he
who had medicine in his mouth was the only one left. Then he took his bow and followed
his elder brothers’ footprints from the side of the house.
</p>
<p>After he had gone up the trail for a while [he came to where] a feather hung. He found
himself in a snare. Suddenly he was hung up in the air. When he got tired he rubbed
medicine upon his neck.
</p>
<p>Very early next day one with vertical lines of paint upon his face came to him upon
the trail inland. “My snare is always lucky” [he said]. Then he pulled him down. He
heard him talk to the snare.
</p>
<p>“Do not let anything pass by you,” he said to it. Then he thought: “I wish he would
carry me face up.” And he seized him by both legs and carried him face up. And, when
he stepped under a fallen tree with him, he took hold of it. After he had tried to
pull him away for a while he let go. By and by he came to his house with him. <span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>He came in and took him off. His elder brothers were cut up and hung in the rear of
the house.
</p>
<p>When they were in bed he gathered together his elder brothers and went away with them.
After he had traveled on for a while he did not see a sign of them. He had forgotten
the medicine he had in his mouth. Then he went back and spit medicine upon them, and
they became alive and started home with him. And next day they came to their town.
</p>
<p>Then they again started off. After they had traveled for a while they disappeared
from the one who had medicine in his mouth. And, after he had hunted for them a while,
he came to some one who was using his head as a drum. Then he asked him: “Did my elder
brothers pass by here?” “Did my elder brothers pass here?” he also said. “I have a
notion to kill you.” He, too, said the same thing. “I have a notion to cut off your
head.” He, also, said the same thing. That was Greatest Echo, they say.
</p>
<p>In whatever way he spoke he could get no answer. By and by, when he said he would
break wind at him, he became afraid. “Don’t do it, chief; don’t do it.” When he broke
wind at him he disappeared. He killed him, they say.
</p>
<p>After that, when he hunted for his elder brothers again, [he came to] a large, round
stone with a slippery top on which a feather was stuck, and on the side of which lay
the bones of his elder brothers. They died while they were trying to pull off the
feather. Then he again spit medicine upon his elder brothers, and they got up. Then
they went away with him.
</p>
<p>After they had gone along for a while they came to where a woman lived. She gave them
all kinds of good food in the usual way. Her dish had the figure of a mouse upon it.
Then they went to bed in her house. There were scratchings in her house all night.
They could not sleep. And, while it was still night, they went away. They came to
the house where their mother and their sister always stayed.
</p>
<p>Then they started off again, and they gave their mother directions. “Settle yourself
in this house. We shall see you no more.” And they took their sister away with them.
</p>
<p>Then they went toward the head of the Stikine river. And, when they started to swim
across, although ten years had passed since their sister had begun to menstruate,
they told her not to look at them. Then they took each other by the arm and swam across.
He who had medicine in his mouth was the last to enter the water. At that time their
sister looked toward them and all [except the eldest] became rocks.
</p>
<p>And their elder brother sang some songs and looked at them. He put the following words
into the song: “Even <span lang="hax">ʟā′ga-na′qatî</span> did not swim across.”<a class="noteRef" id="n261.20src" href="#n261.20">20</a> They settled in this place.<a class="noteRef" id="n261.21src" href="#n261.21">21</a>

<p class="small">The names of the heroes of this story, together with the localities in which the actions

<h2 class="main"><span class="sc">He who hunted birds in his father’s village</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Walter McGregor of the Sealion-town people]
</p>
<p>He was a chief’s son. He wore two marten-skin blankets, one over the other.<a class="noteRef" id="n264.1src" href="#n264.1">1</a> After he had shot birds for some time he went along among some bull pines, which
stood in an open space behind the town and presently heard geese<a class="noteRef" id="n264.2src" href="#n264.2">2</a> calling. Then he went thither. Two women were bathing in a lake. On the shore opposite
two goose skins hung over a stick. The roots of their tails were spotted with white.
</p>
<p>After he had looked a while he ran quickly [to them]. He sat down on the two skins.
Then they asked him for their [skins]. He asked the best looking to marry him. The
other said to him: “Do not marry my younger sister. I am smarter. Marry me.” “No;
I am going to marry your younger sister.” Now she agreed. “Even so, marry my younger
sister. You caught us swimming in the lake our father owns. Come, give me my skin.”
Then he gave it to her. She put her head into it as she swam in the lake. Lo, a goose
swam about in the lake. It swam about in it making a noise.
</p>
<p>Then she flew. She was unwilling to fly away from her younger sister. After she had
flown about above her for a while, she flew up. She vanished through the sky. Then
he gave her (the other) one marten-skin blanket and went home with her. He put his
wife’s skin between the two heads of a cedar standing at one end of the town. He entered
his father’s house with her.
</p>
<p>The chief’s son had a wife. So his father called the people together for the marriage
feast. They gave her food. Instead [of eating it] she merely smelled it. She ate no
kind of human food.
</p>
<p>By and by her mother-in-law steamed some tcꜝāl.<a class="noteRef" id="n264.3src" href="#n264.3">3</a> But she liked that. While her mother-in-law was yet cooking them she told her husband
to tell her to hurry. They put some before her. She ate it all. Then they began giving
her that only to eat.
</p>
<p>One day, when he was asleep, he was surprised to find that his wife’s skin, after
she came in and lay down, was cold. And, when the same thing happened again, he began
watching her. He lay as if asleep. He felt her get up quietly. Then she went out,
and he also went out just after her. She passed in front of the town. She went to
the place where her skin was kept. Thence she flew away. She alighted on the farther
side of a point at one end of the town.
</p>
<p>Then he went thither quickly. She was eating the stalks of the sea grass which grew
there. As the waves broke in they moved her shoreward. <span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>He saw it. Then she flew up to the place where her [feather] skin had been kept. And
he entered the house before her. Then he lay down where they had their bed, after
which his wife lay down cold beside him.
</p>
<p>They became nearly starved in the town. One day the woman said to him from the place
where she was sitting: “Now my father has sent down food to me.” Behind the town geese
were coming down making a great noise, and she went thither. They went with her. All
kinds of good food lay there, such as tcꜝāl<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n265.3src" href="#n264.3">3</a> and wild clover roots. They brought them away. For this her father-in-law called
in the people.
</p>
<p>When this was gone she said the same thing again: “Now my father is bringing food
down to me.” Geese again made a great noise coming down behind the town, and she went
thither. Again heaps of food of all kinds lay around, and they carried that also out.
For that, too, her father-in-law called together the people.
</p>
<p>At that time some one in the town said: “They think a great deal of goose food.” The
woman heard it. Immediately she went off. Her husband in vain tried to stop her. She
went off as one of a strange family would. In the same way he tried to stop her in
front of the town. She went to the place where her skin was. She flew up. She flew
around above the town for a while. Her heart was not strong to fly away from her husband.
By and by she vanished through the sky.
</p>
<p>Then her husband began to walk about the town wailing. By and by he entered the house
of an old man at one end of the town and asked him: “Do you not know the trail that
leads to my wife?” “Why, brave man, you married the daughter of a supernatural being
too great for people even to think of.” At once he began bringing over all sorts of
things to him. After he had given him twisted cedar limbs, a gimlet, and bones,<a class="noteRef" id="n265.4src" href="#n265.4">4</a> he said to him: “Now, brave man, take oil. Take two wooden wedges also. Take, as
well, a comb, thongs, boxes of salmon eggs, the skin of a silver salmon, the point
of a salmon spear.” After he had got all these he came to him. “Old man, here are
all the things you told me to take.” “Now, brave man, go on. The trail runs inland
behind my house.”
</p>
<p>Then he started in on it. After he had gone on for a while he came to some one who
was looking upon himself for lice. Every time he turned around the lice fell off from
him. After he had looked at him unobserved for a while he said to him: “Now, brave
man, do not tickle me by looking at me.<a class="noteRef" id="n265.5src" href="#n265.5">5</a> It was in my mind that you were coming.” Then he came out to him and combed his head.
He also put oil on it. He cleared him of lice. He gave the comb and the hair oil to
him. Then he said to him: “This trail leads to the place where your wife is.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>He again started along the trail. After he had gone on for a while [he saw] a mouse
with cranberries in its mouth going along before him. She came to a fallen tree. She
could not get over it. Then he took her by the back with his fingers and put her across.
Her tail was bent up between her ears [for joy], and she went on before him. Presently
she went among the stalks of a clump of ferns.
</p>
<p>Now he rested himself there. Something said to him: “The chief-woman asks you to come
in.” Then he raised the ferns. He stood in front of a big house. He entered. The chief-woman
was steaming cranberries. She talked as she did so. Her voice sounded sharp. And,
after she had given him something to eat, Mouse-woman said to him: “You helped me
when I went to get some poor cranberries from a patch I own. I will lend you what
I wore when I went hunting when I was young.”
</p>
<p>Then she brought out a box. After she had opened a nest of five boxes, she took out
of the inmost a mouse skin with small, bent claws. And she said to him: “Practice
wearing this.” And, although it was so small, he entered it. It went on easily. Then
he climbed around upon the roof of the house inside. And Mouse-woman said to him again:
“You know how to use it. Now go on.”
</p>
<p>Again he set out upon the trail. After he had gone along for a while he heard some
one grunting under a heavy burden. Then he came to the place. A woman was trying to
carry off a pile of large, flat stones upon her back. The twisted cedar limbs she
had kept breaking. After he had looked at her for a while he went out to her. “Say,
what are you doing?” Then the woman said: “They got me to carry the mountains of the
Haida island. I am doing it.”
</p>
<p>Then he took out his thongs and said to her: “Let me fix it.” And he bound the thongs
around it. He said to her “Now carry it on your back,” and she carried it. It did
not break. Then the woman said to him: “Now, brave man, thank you for helping me.
The trail to your wife’s place runs here.”
</p>
<p>Then he set out upon it. After he had gone on for a while he came to a hill in an
open place on top of which rose something red.<a class="noteRef" id="n266.6src" href="#n266.6">6</a> Then he went to it. Around the bottom of this something lay human bones. There was
no way in which one could go up. Then he entered the mouse skin and rubbed salmon
eggs before him [on the pole]. He went up after it. When he stood on top of this he
clambered up on the sky.
</p>
<p>There, too, there ran a trail, and he started off upon it. After he had gone on for
a while he heard the noise of laughter and singing. After he had gone on a while longer
[he came to where] a big stream flowed down. Near it sat Eagle. On the other side
also sat Heron. Above sat Kingfisher. On the other side sat Black Bear. He (black
<span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>bear) had no claws. He said to Eagle: “Grandfather, lend me some claws.” Then he lent
him some. At that time he came to have claws.
</p>
<p>After he had sat there for a while a half man came vaulting along.<a class="noteRef" id="n267.7src" href="#n267.7">7</a> He had only one leg and one arm. He had but half a head. He speared silver salmon
in the river and pulled them in. Then he entered his silver salmon skin and swam up
to meet him. When he speared him he could not pull him down. Then he cut his string.
And the half man said: “What did it is like a human being.”
</p>
<p>Now he came to him. “Say, did something pull off your spear point?” “Yes,” he said
to him. Then he gave him the one he had. That was Master Hopper, they say. After he
had gone up [he came upon] two large old men who had come after firewood. They were
cutting at the trunks of rotten trees and throwing the chips into the water, when
silver salmon went down in a shoal.
</p>
<p>He went behind and put stones in from behind, and their wedges were broken off. Then
he (one) said: “Alas, they will make trouble for us.” Then he went to them and gave
them his two wedges. They were glad and said to him: “This house is your wife’s.”
</p>
<p>Then he went out [to it]. He went and stood in front of the house. His wife came out
to him. Then he went in with her. She was glad to see her husband. She was the town
chief’s daughter. He remained in the town as her husband. And all the things they
gathered he, too, gathered along with them.
</p>
<p>After he had been there for some time he came to dislike the place. And his wife told
her father. Then his father-in-law called the people. In the house he asked them:
“Who will take my son-in-law down?” And Loon said: “I will take down your son-in-law.”
And he said to him: “How will you do it?” And he said: “I will put him near my tail,
dive into the water right in front with him, come up at the end of his father’s village,
and let him off.” Then they thought he was not strong enough for it.
</p>
<p>Then he asked again. Grebe said the same thing. Him, too, they thought not strong
enough to do it. Then Raven said that he would take him down. And they asked him:
“How are you going to do it?” “I will put him into my armpit and fly down with him
from the end of the town. When I get tired I will fall over and over with him.” Then
they thought he could do it.
</p>
<p>They stood in a crowd at the end of the town looking at him. He did with him as he
had said. When he became very tired and was nearly down he threw him off upon a reef
which lay there. “Yu­waiyā′, what a heavy thing I am taking down.” Shortly he (the
man) was making a noise there as a sea gull.<a class="noteRef" id="n267.8src" href="#n267.8">8</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o, as related to him by an old Ninstints
man]
</p>
<p>He went out from the town to make a canoe. He had two children. His wife was also
with him. When he came in from making the canoe he said: “Would that I had a sister
to bring in food to me.”
</p>
<p>One time at evening burning pitchwood came toward him.<a class="noteRef" id="n269.1src" href="#n269.1">1</a> His sister, who had long ago been carried away by something<a class="noteRef" id="n269.2src" href="#n269.2">2</a> in the woods, came in to him with good food. She talked to him as she used to. Then
she said to him: “Your brother-in-law is going to watch your canoe [to see when it
is time to move it]. When you are ready to turn it over do not go to it for some time
after daybreak.” So she spoke to her brother.
</p>
<p>When he was ready to turn it over he did not go to it for some time. When he did go
to it his canoe had been turned over. Then he worked the bottom of it.
</p>
<p>After that his sister again brought him food. Then his wife wanted to give her something.
She refused it. And they saw her put one of the arms of a crab<a class="noteRef" id="n269.3src" href="#n269.3">3</a> they had eaten which was lying near the fire inside of her blanket. Then they gathered
some for her, and, when she again brought food, they gave them to her. She even took
their hands along with them [for joy]. Every evening his sister came in to him with
food.
</p>
<p>Then she said to her brother: “When you are going to launch the canoe your brother-in-law
says that you had better not go out to it for some time after daybreak.<a class="noteRef" id="n269.4src" href="#n269.4">4</a> Your brother-in-law says he and his friends will bring it out. When he has brought
it out, your brother-in-law says he wants you to bring it to him.” She also told him
whither he should go.
</p>
<p>As soon as he had it ready for launching he did not go to it. When some time had passed
after daybreak he saw it sticking half out of the woods near him. Immediately he and
his wife launched it. Then he went to the place whither his sister had directed him.
</p>
<p>Soon he came to a town. They landed in front of those who had come out of the houses
to meet him. They placed his canoe where he was going to finish it, and his sister
led them into the house.
</p>
<p>After she had given them food they went to bed. When he awoke in the night [he found]
he was pressed in by something. He could in no way stretch out. Those were the roots
of a large tree. When it was day, a good house again stood there.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now, he lived there for a long time. All the while he worked on his canoe. Every night
the earth changed for him. In the morning the house stood there just as it ought to
appear.
</p>
<p>By and by four persons went out by canoe to hunt coots. They called bullheads coots.
After they had been gone for a while only three came back. He (the fourth) was killed
because he forgot the mat to cover his knees. When they forgot this they never escaped.<a class="noteRef" id="n270.5src" href="#n270.5">5</a>
</p>
<p>When his canoe was finished he steamed and spread it. At that time his brothers-in-law
helped him. After that he started to go out in it. All that time she (his sister)
made the child dance. Already it began to have a tail. Then she gave them directions.
She said that when they went outward they should not look back. She said that the
child, who was just able to talk, must not speak about that country. And she also
gave the same directions to him.
</p>
<p>One time, after that, they started off. When they were some distance away the child
remembered the town. And, when he said “How [well] we lived among them,” they were
back again in front of the town. When they again started and had passed beyond the
place where the boy first spoke he repeated the same thing, and again they were back
in front of the town. When they went away again they kept straight on. Then they came
to [their own] town.
</p>
<p>Here it draws to an end.<a class="noteRef" id="n270.6src" href="#n270.6">6</a>
</p>
<p class="small">This is one of the numerous and popular land-otter stories and the only type of story
in which that animal appears in a rôle at all benevolent. Usually he is represented
as trying to steal away some human being and make a slave of him, to deprive one of
his senses or turn him into a gā′gix̣īt (see story of <a href="#ch3.5">Supernatural-being-who-went-naked</a>, note <a href="#n215.19">19</a>). Nevertheless, his peculiar nature brought him into intimate relations with the
shamans, especially among the Tlingit.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by the chief of Kloo, of Those-born-at-Skedans]
</p>
<p>There lay the town of Skedans. The nephew of the town chief there sat around whittling.
He came to have many boxes of arrows. And one day he put shavings into the fire in
front of his uncle’s wife. Then he saw her genitals.
</p>
<p>Then he looked on as they were gambling. His uncle also sat there. By and by a flicker
came flying about. It showed red when it spread its wings. Then he said “Just now
I saw something in the house exactly like that,” whereupon his uncle became ashamed.
</p>
<p>Then his uncle had a block of cedar cut out, and they shaped it like a canoe. Then
they scraped off some pitch, put it into the cedar, warmed it, and made him sit on
it. Then they went out with him to the open sea and put him in it. He was crying.
He cried himself to sleep.
</p>
<p>By and by the wind blew from the ocean. After he had floated for a time he floated
ashore at Broken-shells-of-the-supernatural-beings.<a class="noteRef" id="n271.1src" href="#n271.1">1</a> Then he put his back to the sunshine, and the heat melted him off.
</p>
<p>Now he rose and came to a town. And at evening he peered into the houses. After he
had looked about for a while he looked into the chief’s house and [saw] a woman sitting
between the screens which pointed toward each other. She was pretty. He looked in
at her.
</p>
<p>And, when they all were gone to bed, he went in to her. And the woman asked him: “Who
are you? My father keeps me for him alone whom his uncle had taken toward the open
sea.” And he said to her: “I am he.” Then she let him lie with her. While he was lying
with her her father overheard.
</p>
<p>Next day her father said: “Come! let us see who was talking with my child.” Then he
said: “I wonder what supernatural being got in that way. I was keeping my daughter
for him whom they said his uncle had carried toward the open sea.” “It is he, father,
he says.” “Come down to the fire with your husband, child.” Then she went down with
him, and his father-in-law gave him food.
</p>
<p>And, after he had stayed with her for a while, he told his wife that he wanted to
see his uncle’s town. Then his wife told her father. And he told his son-in-law to
bring him a box which was near the wall. And, when he brought it over to him, he took
four out of it in succession, and began pulling from the inmost the feather clothing
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>an eagle. Then he gave him one among them in which fine black feathers were mixed
with white.
</p>
<p>Then he went outside, put it on (lit., went into it), and flew up to a high frame
in front of the house. He flew easily. Then he flew down. Soon he looked down upon
his uncle’s town. Then he sat at Skedans point. He looked from where he sat at his
uncle’s town.
</p>
<p>By and by some children came to him. And the children shot up at him with blunt arrows.
But every time they shot at him he sat lower down. In the inside of [the skin] he
made himself small. He changed himself many times in a way his father-in-law had given
him directions.<a class="noteRef" id="n272.2src" href="#n272.2">2</a> For that purpose he had given him one all of fine feathers.
</p>
<p>Presently the boys were forbidden to shoot, and the grown people began shooting at
him. Every time they shot at him he came lower. When a big crowd was about him, he
seized one person by the top of his head. And, when he flew up with him, some one
else seized his feet. When he also went up another seized his feet. In the same way
they all seized one another’s feet until he flew up with the whole town. Then he flew
seaward with them and let them fall there. They became islands.<a class="noteRef" id="n272.3src" href="#n272.3">3</a> The town of Skedans became empty. Then he flew up.
</p>
<p>And all the time he was at this town they entered their feather clothing just before
daybreak and sat in line upon a kind of pole, which was in front of the town. After
they had discussed the place they should go to they flew away. In the evening they
flew back. They returned with all kinds of things. They took whale tails, white porpoises,
porpoises; and halibut, red cod, spring salmon—everything one can think of.
</p>
<p>One time he told his wife he wanted to go out for food with them. He wanted to go
for the things they brought in. Then his father-in-law again gave him a [skin]. He
gave him one that belonged to a young person. Then he put it on, flew seaward with
them, and caught spring salmon. His father-in-law was pleased with him.
</p>
<p>And at daybreak his father-in-law warned him. He told him not to touch a thing which
stuck out of the water at Skedans point. And one day, when he flew out with them,
he looked at a whale, thought it easy, and seized it in his talons. He did not feel
it. At that time his father-in-law was still more pleased with him.
</p>
<p>And when day broke he told him all the places upon this island where they get things.
Then he sat with them in front of the house, and even to the south end of the island
the things under the waters, fish and sea mammals,<a class="noteRef" id="n272.4src" href="#n272.4">4</a> were plainly visible to him.
</p>
<p>One day he flew downward and nearly touched the thing sticking out. And, when he did
the same thing again, he <span class="corr" id="xd32e25612" title="Source: siezed">seized</span> it. He flapped his wings to pull it up. It acted like a solid object and nearly carried
him under the water. Another took hold of the end of his wing. He, <span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>too, was drawn under, and another seized his wing. As soon as they saw him they flew
toward him from the south end of the island and from the north end of the island.
All flew about above him. They also saw him from the town. The first were drawn in.
They were nearly all pulled in one after the other, holding each other’s wings, when
the town people, too, came flying thither. Those, too, were at once drawn in.
</p>
<p>Then his father-in-law and his wife dressed themselves. And, when those also were
almost drawn under, and his wife was nearly drawn under with them, his wife’s grandmother
also dressed herself. She sharpened her claws which were dull. At the same time she
said: “Ha-i ha-i, what things happen by means of the claws of my child’s husband,
ha-i ha-i.” She was very old, they say.
</p>
<p>By and by she flew out and seized her. After she had flapped her wings for a while
she saw one coming up. As she saw another one come up something cracked at the bottom
of the island. Then she pulled them out. The thing came up with them. That was Greatest-clam
(stᴀn),<a class="noteRef" id="n273.5src" href="#n273.5">5</a> they say.
</p>
<p>Then the town was restored. And he again began getting food for his father-in-law
as formerly. But Skedans continued to lie empty. That is why the same thing keeps
happening to it, they say.<a class="noteRef" id="n273.6src" href="#n273.6">6</a>
</p>
<p>[Another version of this story, obtained by Prof. Franz Boas from Charlie Edenshaw,
chief of the Stᴀ′stas, a prominent Masset family.]
</p>
<p>At Lāltg·iwas,<a class="noteRef" id="n273.7src" href="#n273.7">7</a> near Skidā′ns, lived a chief and his sister, who had a son. This young man loved
the chief’s wife. When the chief discovered this he became jealous and thought of
killing his nephew. He sent his slaves to fetch gum. The slaves went and bought a
canoe load of gum, which the chief boiled. Then he covered the board which covers
the bow of the canoe with the gum. After this was done he sent his slaves to shoot
eagles, and he spread the down over the gum so as to make it invisible. After he had
thus prepared his canoe he called his nephew. His slaves went into his house to call
him. He obeyed their summons, and went to his uncle’s house, who requested him to
go out to sea, hunting. The young man took his quiver, which contained two bows and
many arrows. The young man asked his uncle: “What kind of a blanket shall I wear when
I go hunting?” Then the chief gave him two marten blankets. He continued: “What kind
of ear ornament shall I wear when I go hunting?” His uncle gave him ear ornaments
made of caribou skin (tsʼᴇnʟqal = caribou).
</p>
<p>When the weather was clear and calm he started hunting seals (xōt). Before they started
the chief said to his slaves: “When he harpoons a seal push him so that he will fall
on the board in the bow of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>canoe. He will stick to it, and then throw him overboard.” They went out to sea, and,
when the young man was about to harpoon a seal, the slave pushed him so that he fell
down on the board. He was unable to free himself because the gum was holding him.
Then the slaves took the board, threw it overboard, and returned home. They said that
the young man had fallen overboard and that they had been unable to save him. Then
all the people were sad.
</p>
<p>The young man drifted about on the sea, and the wind drifted the board ashore near
a town. He crawled up toward the houses, but, when the sun was shining warmly, the
gum softened, and he was able to free himself. He dried his blankets in the warm sunshine.
</p>
<p>Now he heard two women singing. Their voices were very beautiful. After a while they
approached him. They were very beautiful. They addressed him, saying: “We know that
your uncle is jealous of you, and therefore he ordered his slaves to throw you into
the sea. Accompany us to our father’s country. It is not far from here. We will look
after you.” Then he accompanied them, and soon they arrived at a large town. One of
the girls was the chief’s daughter, while the other one was her slave. She was the
daughter of the Eagle.
</p>
<p>Now they entered the chief’s house. He was offered a seat and was given to eat. The
chief was glad to see him. The girl’s mother, whose name was G̣ōtsō′na, was very old.
She was quite bald. Early every morning the Eagles went out hunting whales. When they
returned they gave the whales to the old woman. One day the youth desired to accompany
the hunters. He said to his wife: “Tell your father that I wish to see how he hunts
whales.” The young woman told her father, who replied: “Here is an eagle skin. Give
it to your husband.” He put it on and flew out with the Eagles. Before he started,
the old woman warned him, saying: “Don’t try to catch a clam. Its head looks just
like that of a sea otter. A long time ago one of our hunters tried to catch it, and
it drowned him. For this reason we are afraid of it.”
</p>
<p>They went out to sea and saw many whales. The young man caught one. He did not find
it difficult to lift it. The eagle skin which he had on was one the chief had used
when he was a young man. For that reason it made him very strong. In the evening they
returned, and he gave his whale to the old woman. He was so eager to go out again
whaling that he was unable to sleep. Early next morning he started and continued to
catch whales. Thus he continued to do for many years. The old woman warned him frequently,
saying: “Don’t try to catch that small black animal whose head looks like that of
a sea otter.”
</p>
<p>One morning, when he started, he thought: “To-day I shall try to catch two whales,
one in each hand.” When he saw two whales he <span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>swooped down and took one in each talon. He did not find them too heavy and carried
them home. He gave them to the old woman. When he found that he was strong enough
to lift two whales, he thought he would be able to conquer the animal of which the
old woman had warned him. He started early in the morning, and, as soon as he saw
the clam, he swooped down on it and succeeded in lifting it. But soon he felt his
strength leaving him, and he began to sink down lower and lower. Now the clam had
dragged him down to the surface of the water. Then one of the Eagles came to his assistance.
He took hold of his wings and tried to pull him up, but in vain. The clam pulled him
down. Another Eagle came to their help, but they were unable to overcome the clam.
All the whale hunters came to their assistance, but all of them were dragged down
under the water.
</p>
<p>Now only one of the Eagles was left. He returned home and told the old woman what
had happened. Then she said: “Ngai, ngai, ngai!” She sharpened her nails and put on
her skin, which looked very old and ragged. Now she was an old Eagle, who had lost
many feathers. She flew out to sea, and sang: “Why did my son-in-law disobey me? Ngai,
ngai, ngai!” When she came to the place where the clam had drowned the Eagles, she
saw the wings of one Eagle only above the surface of the water. She took hold of them
and tried to lift them. She was almost dragged under water; but gradually she began
to rise. She tried three times. The fourth time she succeeded in raising the Eagle.
Again she sang: “Why did my son-in-law disobey me? Ngai, ngai, ngai!” Then she heard
a noise under water, “Ox!” Then she lifted all the Eagles, and took them back home.
</p>
<p>Now the young man resolved to take revenge on the people who had killed him. He put
on his eagle skin and flew to his uncle’s village. There he alighted on the top of
a tree. When the people saw him they attempted to shoot him, because they were desirous
of obtaining the Eagle’s feathers for winging their arrows; but they were unable to
hit him. Now his uncle’s son attempted to shoot him. At once he swooped down, grasped
him, and carried him upward. One of the men of the village tried to hold the boy,
but he also was lifted upward; and thus he raised all the men of the village. He carried
them out to sea and dropped them into the water, where they were drowned.
</p>
<p>The young man continued to live there for many years, but finally he became homesick.
He did not laugh and stayed at home all the time. Then the old woman asked her daughter:
“Why is your husband sad?” His wife replied: “He wishes to return to his uncle’s village.”
Then the old woman gave him the skin of the bird tʼᴇn. [It has a red throat, and is
eaten by the whites].<a class="noteRef" id="n275.8src" href="#n275.8">8</a> He put it on and flew back. The village was entirely deserted, because he had killed
all the <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>people. Only his two younger sisters remained, who had been hidden at the time of
his former visit. They were crying all the time. When they saw the bird they made
a noose of their own hair, and he allowed himself to be caught.

<h2 class="main"><span class="sc">The story about him who destroyed his nine nephews</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Walter McGregor of the Sea-lion-town people.]
</p>
<p>A town chief began letting his nephews have his wife.<a class="noteRef" id="n277.1src" href="#n277.1">1</a> Every time he led one away, and he never came back. He had them go and get an old
dead tree which he said he owned, and they never came back from it. He let them [go
after] bark and set a net for a cormorant which he said he owned, and they never came
back. After he had done this way for a while, nine were destroyed.
</p>
<p>And their younger brother came to know it. Then he began bathing in the sea. After
he had bathed for a while he became strong. He smashed anything he took hold of. He
also twisted and pulled out spruce limbs. When he had become truly strong he began
to make various things. He finished two wedges. And he also took a sg̣u′nskaxaua shell.<a class="noteRef" id="n277.2src" href="#n277.2">2</a> He sharpened it. And he took a weasel skin and feathers. And he pressed mud taken
from the woods hard together in his hands and made a hole within it. He made it large
enough to get into.
</p>
<p>Then he put paint upon his face and sat on top of the house. After he had sat there
for a while his uncle came out. When he saw him he went back. His uncle was always
jealous. One came out to call him in to his uncle. Then he went thither.
</p>
<p>When he entered a mat was spread out for him. And, after he had given him some food,
he said to him: “Nephew, you shall marry my wife.” Then he lay with her.
</p>
<p>Next day he said to him: “Nephew, go and get a rotten tree I own behind the town.”
He had his two wedges hidden about him. His uncle went ahead of him. He followed.
He opened a crack where it lay. Something braced it apart. Then his uncle dropped
a wedge in and asked him to get it. Then he went in and got it. He knocked out the
brace. The crack came close together. Then he heard his uncle rejoice [saying]: “Look
at him whom I killed because he wanted to marry my wife.” Then his uncle started off.
</p>
<p>Then he began to cut it from the place where he was. And he cut a hole and came out.
Then he split it open. He took his elder brothers out. Then he broke half of [the
log] by jumping on it and threw it around. And half of it he carried home on his shoulder
and threw it down hard in front of the house. That was his uncle’s supernatural power,
they say. Again he slept with his [uncle’s] wife.
</p>
<p>Next day his uncle said to him: “Come! nephew, go with me to get the cormorant I own
which is sitting over yonder.” Then he <span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>took his weasel and feather and went with him to get it. His uncle set a net where
some sticks stuck out on top of a very high cliff. A cormorant got into it. Then he
said to him: “Now, nephew, get it.” And, when he started down upon the pole, he pushed
his nephew over. Then he put himself into the feather and dropped easily. He heard
his uncle rejoice. “Look at the one whom I killed because he wanted to marry my wife.”
Then he started off.
</p>
<p>Now he entered his weasel skin and climbed up the cliff. And he stretched the net
across. In it he caught a number of cormorants. After he had taken them out he tore
his uncle’s net to pieces and threw the pieces about. Then he took the cormorants
on his back and brought them into the house. They were his uncle’s supernatural helpers.
</p>
<p>The day after that his uncle went with him to get bark. He concealed the thing he
had made. He followed his uncle. By and by [they came to] the bark which was burning,
and his uncle took some of it. Then he told him to get some also. When he did so he
pushed him into it. And he got inside of the mud he had pressed together. He did not
feel the burning. Then his uncle said he was glad. His uncle said: “Look at the man
whom I killed because he wanted to marry my wife. He will try it no longer.”
</p>
<p>When his uncle started away from him, he went to the place, pushed the bark down,
and threw it around. Then he carried some home on his shoulder and threw it down inside.
That was his uncle’s supernatural helper, they say. And again he slept with his [uncle’s]
wife.
</p>
<p>Next day he again said to his nephew: “Come! nephew and go with me for a small cockle
I own, which is just over yonder.” Then he started thither with him. He took his knife.
The cockle opened its mouth. Then his uncle told him to get it and, when he went to
get it, he pushed him into its mouth. Again his uncle rejoiced. “Look at the one whom
I killed because he wanted to marry my wife.”
</p>
<p>When his uncle started off he cut the ligaments<a class="noteRef" id="n278.3src" href="#n278.3">3</a> with the knife and pushed it open. Then he threw half of it around and carried half
of it off on his shoulders and threw it down in the house. He had destroyed all of
his supernatural helpers, they say.
</p>
<p>Then he spread out a bearskin for them and had them lie there. While he slept his
uncle and his friends took him up and put him into a box. Then his uncle put cords
around it. And they took him far out to sea toward the middle of the ocean. And there
they threw him into the water. Again he rejoiced and went home.
</p>
<p>After he had floated about for some time he felt himself float ashore upon the sand.
When he was about to burst the cover by stretching he heard two women talking together,
saying as follows: “Cloud-watcher,<a class="noteRef" id="n278.4src" href="#n278.4">4</a> a box has floated ashore.” And, when he heard it, he did not burst the box.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb279">[<a href="#pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p>The two women removed the lid and pulled him up. Then Cloud-watcher’s elder sister
said as follows: “I will marry him because I saw him first.” Then they led him home,
and they led him into their father’s house. They were glad to see him.
</p>
<p>After they had given him something to eat he went out. And, after he had walked about
in the town for a while, he entered the middle house. Numbers of eagle skins were
hung there, and he entered one made of fine feathers. He flapped his wings. He almost
went through the doorway. He seized the boards along the side of the door. Then he
came out of it quickly. And he entered his father’s house. His father-in-law said:
“I wonder why my skin tickles as if they were playing with my feather clothing.” He
was town mother, they say.
</p>
<p>Next day, very early, he heard eagles making a noise. Then he went out to look. The
eagles sat in rows upon something raised high up in front of the house.<a class="noteRef" id="n279.5src" href="#n279.5">5</a> On it they made a noise. After they had spent some time sharpening their talons they
went hunting. After they had been gone for a while and evening was come they returned
with spring salmon in their talons. Some of them had red cod and pieces of whale.
</p>
<p>Next day he heard them scream again in front of the house, and he told his wife he
wanted to learn to hunt. Then she also told her father. And his father-in-law said:
“Now, my child, I will lend your husband the one I used to go out fishing in when
I was a youth.” Then he brought out a box. He picked one out of it covered with small,
fine feathers. And, when he gave it to her, he said to her: “Tell your husband not
to go toward something small which sticks out near by.”
</p>
<p>Then he flew seaward with them and got a whale jaw. He came in before them. They caught
all kinds of things. His father-in-law was pleased with him. Then they cooked the
whale. When they began to eat it they pulled an old woman shaking with age out and
said to her: “Drink whale broth, old woman.” And she did as they told her.
</p>
<p>The day after that he flew out again with them. And he felt different (i.e., powerful).
And he took a whale jaw. On the other side he took a spring salmon. He flew home before
all. They got all sorts of things. And, when they again began to eat the whale, they
led in the old woman, and she drank whale broth.
</p>
<p>When he went to hunt with them the day after he nearly touched the thing which stuck
out of the water with his claws and finally seized it. After he had flapped his wings,
as he held it, for a while he vanished under the water. Then another seized his wings.
He, too, was nearly dragged under. And one brought news to the town that he had seized
the wrong thing.
</p>
<p>Then the old woman sharpened her claws which were dull, saying meanwhile: “Ha-i ha-i,
what wrong thing did my child’s (i.e., grandchild’s) husband get hold of?” Her wings
had lost feathers [from <span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>age]. She flew down. She was unable to fly in a straight line. She flew hither and
thither. When about five were left she got there, and, when those were nearly covered,
she seized them with her claws. After she had flapped her wings for a while, tugging
at them, she drew one of them to the surface. She was at the end of them. Something
cracked at the bottom where the thing was. She pulled it out.
</p>
<p>Then they said: “Put it far from the place where human beings are going to get food.”
And they dropped it far out at sea. Then he seized the jaw of a whale and a spring
salmon. He flew home with them. He killed the thing they were afraid of. That was
Supernatural-clam,<a class="noteRef" id="n280.6src" href="#n280.6">6</a> they say.
</p>
<p>And, after he had lived with his wife for some time, he went to see his uncle’s town.
He flew to the town wearing his eagle skin. And, after he had sat at the end of the
town for a while, he saw his uncle come out. Then he flew away.
</p>
<p>And early next day he flew seaward, picked up a whale, and dropped it in front of
his uncle’s house while they slept. Then he sat on a dead tree that stood at one end
of the town. After he had sat there for a while some one came out. He called them
to the whale, and they went to it. His uncle said he would keep it for himself. He
stood on top of the whale.
</p>
<p>Then he flew. He flew about above the place where his uncle was walking about. And
they laughed at him. They said “He wants the whale meat.” And again he sat on the
tree. After he had sat there for a while his uncle said he wanted all of the whale
for himself. He said that as he stood around. Presently he flew over to him. He seized
him by the knot in his hair and flew away with him.
</p>
<p>After he had flown along for a while he discovered that it was his nephew, and he
said: “Nephew, carry me back. You shall marry my wife. I will give the town to you.”
After he had flown on with him a while longer he said the same thing to his nephew
again. After he had flown on still farther with him he dropped him in the open sea.<a class="noteRef" id="n280.7src" href="#n280.7">7</a>
</p>
<p>Then he flew landward, reached his uncle’s village, married his uncle’s wife, and
came to own the town. His uncle became a supernatural being in the open sea.

he began to bid the property of his clansmen.<a class="noteRef" id="n281.1src" href="#n281.1">1</a> When he had lost a great deal of that as well he was ashamed to enter the house.

<p>By and by he went to the end of the town. It occurred to him to go into the woods.

him eagles wheeled about upon the mountain. Presently he came to a big town.

<p>He saw eagles sitting upon something like a pole in front of the town. They were looking

<h2 class="main"><span class="sc">The one they abandoned because he was the first to spear sea lions</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Walter McGregor of the Sealion-town people.]
</p>
<p>A good carpenter had two children. People went to a reef to hunt, and he made spears
for this. And he fastened them with cords. He used any sort of strong thing for this
purpose. He fastened a point on the spear. Then they drove the sea lions into a pool
of water on top of the reef. He speared the sea lions. And he pulled in the spear
handle and put another point into it. He killed the sea lions in this way.
</p>
<p>And, after he had done this for a while, one day they went thither, let him off first,
and abandoned him. But his youngest brother-in-law paddled toward him. When he was
far off he (the youngest brother-in-law) tried to take away their paddles. He was
fighting to do so. He saw it. He called after them. They paid no attention to him.
They were unable to kill the sea lions. He only could kill them. That is why they
left him.
</p>
<p>Then he cried for his children on top of the island. After he had cried for a time
he lay down near the pond. As he slept there something said to him: “The chief asks
you to come in.” He looked for the cause of it. He saw not a sign of a thing. He saw
something dive into the lake. And, after he had lain a while longer, something spoke
to him as before. Then he looked through the eyeholes in his marten-skin blanket.
He saw a grebe<a class="noteRef" id="n282.1src" href="#n282.1">1</a> come to the surface of the pond. After it had swum about for a while it said: “The
chief asks you to come in.” Then it dove.
</p>
<p>Then he took a whetstone he had and jumped into the pond. He stood in front of a big
house, and they asked him to come in. He entered, and they inquired of him: “Why did
you kill my servants?” And he said: “I did it to feed my two children.”
</p>
<p>And he saw two small killer whales blowing about in a pool of water in the corner
of the house. Those were the chief’s two children at play. He saw killer-whale fins
hung up in bunches in the four corners.
</p>
<p>Then they gave him something to eat. They dragged a sea lion sitting on the side toward
the door to the fire and put hot stones that were in the fire into its mouth. And
they also put halibut into its mouth. When [the latter] was cooked they gave it to
him to eat.
</p>
<p>And after he was through eating they brought one of the fins which were in the corner.
And they warmed the lower end of it. And, after they had bent him over, he put a whetstone
on his back. When they struck it on it fell off. On top of the stone floor planks
the fin lay shaking. They went to get another. After they had warmed that in the same
way at the fire they had him bend over. And he <span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>placed the whetstone on his back. When they struck it upon him that also slipped off.
That, too, fell upon the stone floor planks.
</p>
<p>And they got another one. When the same thing happened to that they got a long one.
After they had warmed that, also, for a while they bent him over. He again placed
the whetstone on his back. When they struck that one on, it also fell to the stone
floor planks. After four attempts they gave it up.
</p>
<p>Then the chief said: “Let him out. He refuses the fins. Put him into a sea lion’s
stomach.” And the chief said to him: “After you have floated about and have struck
against land four times, get out. You will have floated ashore on good ground.” At
once they put him into a sea lion’s stomach, and he tied it together from inside.
They threw him out.
</p>
<p>And, after he had floated shoreward and had floated against the land four times, he
got out. He had floated ashore upon a nice beach. Then he again tied up the sea lion’s
stomach air-tight and threw it out. The stomach vanished seaward against the wind.
</p>
<p>Then he started toward the town and stayed at the end of it until evening. And in
the evening he looked in at his wife. He saw that his wife’s hair was burnt short
and pitch was upon her face. He also saw his two children sitting there. Then he tapped
on the wall opposite his wife, and his wife went out. Then he said to his wife: “Bring
me my tools.” Then she gave them to him. And he said: “Do not let anyone know about
me. Conceal it even from my children.”
</p>
<p>And, when he started off from there, he took one from among some children who were
playing about and started inland with him. After he had gone on for some time he came
to where a big lake lay. Then he cut on the lakeward side of a large cedar standing
near it. And, after he had cut it on the back side, it fell across the lake. Then
he split it from the butt end, and, as soon as he had split it, he put a crosspiece
in.
</p>
<p>Then he twisted cedar limbs. He spliced them together. When the rope became long he
fastened the child to it. Then he let it down between. After it struck the bottom,
and he had held it for a while it began jerking, and he pulled it toward himself.
The lake was also boiling. Its hands came out first. And when its head followed them
to the surface, he knocked out the brace quickly. It struggled in it. After he had
struck it several times it died.
</p>
<p>Then he pulled it out. He was going to cut it open in front. Lightning shot about.
So he cut it open, beginning at the lower part of its back. Then he skinned it. Its
tail was nice. It was bent over. Then he lighted a fire and dried it. That was a Wā′sg̣o,
they say. When it was dry he rolled it up and brought it out.
</p>
<p>Then he hid it in a forked cedar tree at the end of the town. He put moss over it.
Then he started for the end of the town and made killer whales out of cedar. He put
fins on them and kicked them into <span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>the water. But they only blew bubbles close to the kelps. Then he said: “Go where
you are to be settled.” Those were the porpoises, they say. And he also worked hemlock
into killer whales. When ten of those were also finished he kicked them into water.
After they had been gone for some time bubbles like steam arose seaward. And he thought
they were unable to do anything. And he said: “Go where your place is to be.” Those
were the white porpoises,<a class="noteRef" id="n284.2src" href="#n284.2">2</a> they say.
</p>
<p>Fine weather continued. All that time the people were fishing.
</p>
<p>And the next day, after he had thought what he would use, he made ten killer whales
out of yew wood. The surfaces were variegated, striped with white. Their bellies were
white. The corners of their mouths were also striped with white. The fin of one of
them had a hole in it, and one fin was bent over toward the tail. While he was making
them they moved. For them he laid a log down [horizontally]. There he placed them,
and he kicked them about. Presently bubbles of air rose far out at sea. Then he told
them to come in, and he pulled them up again. They had red cod, spring salmon, and
halibut in their mouths.
</p>
<p>And in the evening he went to his wife. He looked in again. He tapped opposite his
wife, and his wife came out to him. And he said to her: “When they go out fishing
again to-morrow tell your youngest brother to fasten a feather in his hair.”
</p>
<p>The next day they went fishing, and he gave directions to the killer whales. “Destroy
all the people out fishing. Break up their canoes with your fins. Save only the one
who has a feather in his hair.” Then he kicked them off. After they had been gone
for a while bubbles rose beyond the place where the canoes were anchored. Then the
killer whales came back to the canoes. Bubbles of air rose among them. The killer
whales broke up the canoes with their fins. They chewed up the bodies of the people.
Only the one who had a feather in his hair was left swimming about. And, when they
were destroyed, he got into the broken canoe, and the killer whales came landward
with him in a school. Then he got off in front of the town.
</p>
<p>And he again called the killer whales. Then he gave them directions. And he said to
the one that had a hole in its fin: “You shall be called: ‘Hole-in-his-fin.’ ” And
he said to the one with the fin bent back: “You shall be called: ‘Fin-turned-back.’ ”
Then he said: “Go to Na-iku′n. Settle down there. That land is good. You shall be
called ‘Strait people.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="n284.3src" href="#n284.3">3</a>
</p>
<p>And he went to his wife with the things the killer whales had caught in their mouths.
His two children were glad to see him.
</p>
<p>And, after he had stayed at the town for a while, he went out while they slept and
put on his wā′sg̣o skin. Then with his hands he merely reached for something at the
end of the town. He got half a spring salmon.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span></p>
<p>And his mother-in-law always hated him. She always got up very early. He laid it down
for her in front of the house. Then his mother-in-law went out very early. She found
half a spring salmon. She was glad to have it.
</p>
<p>The same night he put on his wā′sg̣o skin. He let the water come up even with his
elbow. He took out half a halibut. Then he laid it down for his mother-in-law, and
in the morning she found it. The town people had become hungry.
</p>
<p>And in the night he again entered his wā′sg̣o skin and plunged his whole arm into
the water. He seized a whole spring salmon. Then he again left it for the woman, and
she found it in the morning.
</p>
<p>That night he again entered his wā′sg̣o skin. And he let the water come up as far
as his shoulders. Then he took a whale jaw and put it down for his mother-in-law.
And she found that also.
</p>
<p>Then his mother-in-law began acting like a shaman. And they fasted with her for four
nights. He was with them. His mother-in-law was going to get power from him.
</p>
<p>In the night he put on the wā′sg̣o skin. He swam seaward. He killed a whale. A spear
stuck out of the nostrils of the wā′sg̣o.<a class="noteRef" id="n285.4src" href="#n285.4">4</a> He killed the whale with that. Then he put it between his ears and swam landward
with it. And he laid it in front of the house, because she said a whale would float
ashore.
</p>
<p>And again, while they slept, he swam out in the wā′sg̣o skin. And he took two whales.
He swam landward with them. He put one between his ears, and he also put one near
his tail. Swimming landward, he placed those also in front of the house.
</p>
<p>The next night he swam far out to sea with the wā′sg̣o skin on, and he took ten whales.
He had them on each side of his head between his ears. He also had some lying crosswise
near his tail. And he piled them upon himself and had one in his mouth. Then he came
shoreward.
</p>
<p>While he was still out at sea daylight came. When he reached shore his mother-in-law
came down to him wearing a dancing hat. Then he stood up out of the wā′sg̣o skin and
said to her: “Why is your face hard? Does some supernatural power come through you
by my help?” And he made her die of shame. The wā′sg̣o skin went off of itself. Then
he gathered his ten whales and told no one to cut them. What he received from the
sale of the whales made him rich. He potlatched ten times for his youngest brother-in-law.
He kept him like a chief’s son.

</p>
<p>A man and his wife were abandoned at the town of Sqa-i<a class="noteRef" id="n286.1src" href="#n286.1">1</a><span class="corr" id="xd32e25864" title="Not in source">.</span> After they had lived there together for a while, his wife began getting mussels at

</p>
<p>After a while he became suspicious of her. And one time, when she went after mussels,
he followed her stealthily. When she got near the place where she was going to get
mussels she went along singing. She beat upon her mat with her digging stick in lieu
of a drum. When she got near the place where the mussels were a whale jumped ashore
sideways just in front of her. Then she went to it, and she lay with it. And the whale
went off blowing. He saw it.
</p>
<p>Then he knew, and he went away. Then he began to sharpen a mussel-shell at some place
where she could not see him. It became sharp, and one day, when it was low tide, he
sent his wife to get spruce roots for him.
</p>
<p>Then he made clothing for himself like his wife’s, took the basket, and wore the mat
as a blanket. Then he went along the beach of Stasqa′os. And, when he approached the
place where his wife was in the habit of getting mussels, he used his mat as a drum.
When he sang the same words, the black whale came ashore on its side in front of him.
Then he went to it and cut off its penis. Then it got up quickly and went into the
water making a noise. Its cries died away into the ocean.
</p>
<p>Then he came home and built a fire. And he put stones into the fire. Then he sliced
it up, and, when the stones were hot, he steamed it. After it was cooked his wife
came home.
</p>
<p>Then she asked her husband: “What things are you steaming?” “I found some things which
had floated ashore. I am steaming them for you. They are cooked. Take the covers off.”
Then they took the covers off. Before they had even put them into the tray she took
the piece off of the top and ate it.
</p>
<p>After she had taken one bite he said to her: “Is your husband’s penis sweet?” She
dropped it at once. Immediately she turned toward the door. Right where she sat she
shook. Even the ground shook.
</p>
<p>And, when his wife started off, he tried to hold her. He could not. Then she went
out, and he went out after her. And, after he had followed her closely for a while,
she went up in the bed of a creek at the end of Stasqa′os. All that time he kept looking
at her. And, when <span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>she got up toward the mountain, she again recalled her husband’s words.
</p>
<p>Now she sat on top of the mountain, and she again remembered what her husband had
said. And, while sitting there, she became ashamed. Then she played in the earth with
the tip of her finger. She made a hole with her finger far into the island. She did
not feel how she did it. When she stood up she picked up some dirt and threw it into
it. “All future people will do this way to you.”<a class="noteRef" id="n287.2src" href="#n287.2">2</a>
</p>
<p>Then she went away and came to the west coast. And she went out on one side of Elderberry
point. Then she jumped into the water in front of her. He did not know that he had
married a female killer whale that had been born of a woman.<a class="noteRef" id="n287.3src" href="#n287.3">3</a> Then she settled herself down before him. She became a reef. It is called “Woman.”
When people get off from a canoe upon it, it shakes with them, they say.<a class="noteRef" id="n287.4src" href="#n287.4">4</a>
</p>
<p>And there she again recalled her husband’s words, and she went away from there also.
Where she again settled down on the west coast as a reef, they also call it “Woman.”

<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham, of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o, to whom it was related by an old Ninstints
man.]
</p>
<p>A man, along with his sister, was abandoned by his nine uncles. They built a small
house under a tree. He lived in this with his sister. After they had lived there for
a while two ravens came flying from the west coast. Then they sat on a branch of the
tree below which they lived and wiped their bills. Afterward they flew back in the
direction from which they had come. They disappeared over the mountain.
</p>
<p>After this had happened many times while they were living there they began to be suspicious.
Then they conferred with each other. He asked his sister to go with him in the direction
the ravens always took when they flew over. Immediately they started up in the bed
of Stasqa′os creek.
</p>
<p>When they got far up they came to the end of a trail. And they went up upon it. When
they got to the top of the mountain [they found] a hole there. The bottom could not
be seen. And when they started to leave it they came back to it again. They kept doing
so all day. A short time after they had started from it they came back to it.
</p>
<p>Then the man became angry, took dirt in his hand and threw it in. “Yawaiyā′⁺, it makes
people come back who try to go away from it,” said he.<a class="noteRef" id="n288.1src" href="#n288.1">1</a> Then, when they started away, they came to the town-site of Ku′ndi.<a class="noteRef" id="n288.2src" href="#n288.2">2</a>
</p>
<p>Three rows of whales had floated ashore there. Those in the row nearest land were
rotten. Those in the next row were a little rotten. Those next the sea were fresh.
Killer whales came out to sleep on a reef which ran out into the strait. They made
a noise, touching each other.
</p>
<p>Then he and his sister constructed a house. When it was finished he cut up some fresh
whales. At the same time he steamed them.
</p>
<p>And one night he heard something whispering to his sister. He did not ask her about
it. The night after that he again heard something talking to his sister. Then in the
morning he asked his sister: “What talked to you in the night?” “Brother,<a class="noteRef" id="n288.3src" href="#n288.3">3</a> they tell me a strange thing. Kꜝū′dᴀña-point will marry me. If you agree, they say
they will give you much food. If you agree, they direct you to make a strong club.
When the house is full they direct you to stand outside the door. Then they direct
you to break their heads with your club.” He agreed. Evening came again, and his sister
was gone in the morning.
</p>
<p>He finished his club. Then good-looking people came in to him. <span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span>Some had curly hair. When there was a great crowd in the house he stood outside. And,
as soon as they went out, he struck them on their heads. Right there they fell dead.
They became sea otters and hair seals. They say that Kꜝū′dᴀña-point owns the west
coast sea otters.
</p>
<p>After some time had passed away, two of his uncles’ slaves hunted for him. They came
to him. Then, after he had given them food, he told them that they should not say
how he was situated. He did not give them food to take home, but one slave concealed
a small piece under his tongue for his child. Then they went home.
</p>
<p>After some time had passed, his uncles came around <span class="corr" id="xd32e25938" title="Source: Sta-i-point">Sqa-i-point</span>. The slaves had told about him. That is why they were there. When they abandoned
him at Sqa-i his youngest uncle’s wife, although they were watching each other, left
him food enough in a neat way to last him for some time.
</p>
<p>As they came along his uncles’ daughters were dressed up and sat high in the canoes.
Near them coppers were raised upon poles. Then he called in the youngest. But he refused
the others. And they started back.
</p>
<p>Then he married the daughter of the youngest. And after that a town arose there. They
bought food from him. He became a chief there.

man]
</p>
<p>Some people were abandoned at Stasqa′os, including a man, his wife, and his mother-in-law.
The latter owned some salmon eggs. When it became cold and he was very hungry he wished
his mother-in-law would cut them open, and he brought in firewood. After he had built
a large fire he thought he would get something from his mother-in-law. He was unsuccessful.
He was hungry many mornings and brought firewood to his mother-in-law, all the time
expecting to get the salmon eggs.
</p>
<p>By and by, when the snow was gone, he sent his wife out to get spruce roots for himself.
While his wife was digging spruce roots she heard a puppy bark within the earth. Then
she started to dig it out. She dug out a little puppy. And she went home with it.
Then they reared it. It grew up very fast.
</p>
<p>One morning, when they got up, two large fish lay outside. They ate them. Next morning
some lay there again. The number increased. After the fish had been found there in
this way for a while half a halibut lay there. Another time a whole halibut lay there.
After there had been halibut for some time porpoises began lying there. After that
had happened for a while hair seal began lying there. After they had been found lying
there for a time a whale’s tail lay there. Again half of a whale lay there. The dog
also became large.
</p>
<p>After this, when they became tired of eating grease, she cut open the salmon eggs.
His mother-in-law gave some to him. He did not look at them.
</p>
<p>When his mother-in-law had become tired of eating grease she went after things found
at low tide. Then he covered all the chitons with rotten whale. Instead of eating
them his mother-in-law went in and sat down. There came to be whole whales [lying
on the beach]. Stasqa′os beach was all covered with whales.
</p>
<p>Then, unbeknown to her son-in-law, she collected urine. She put hot stones into it,
and, while the dog was out at sea and her son-in-law was sleeping with his wife, she
poured it into the sea. At once a great east wind arose. When daylight came the wind
increased.
</p>
<p>Then he saw the dog’s ears show at intervals above the water in front of Stasqa′os.<a class="noteRef" id="n290.1src" href="#n290.1">1</a> After he had looked for a while they disappeared around Gᴀ′ñxet-point.<a class="noteRef" id="n290.2src" href="#n290.2">2</a> After that the waves carried it along the west coast out to sea.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Walter McGregor of the Sea-lion-town people]
</p>
<p>He was going along in his canoe with his two children and his wife. It was low tide.
After he had gone along for a while [he came to a place] where devilfish stones lay.
A great quantity of leavings from its (the devilfish’s) food were piled up there.
He got off to kill it. Then, while he was punching it with a stick the devilfish came
out. Immediately it wound itself around him and pulled him into its hole.
</p>
<p>And, after his wife and children had remained there for a while, the rocks were covered
with water, and they went away from him. Then the woman went home. She expected never
to get him back.
</p>
<p>The [devilfish] woman took him to her father’s town. At that time he heard them use
bad words<a class="noteRef" id="n292.1src" href="#n292.1">1</a> to the hair seals. When day broke he hunted about for food among the waves below
the capes, they used to say. He remained with her in her father’s town.
</p>
<p>After many years had passed he remained in bed two mornings. At that time the chief
asked his daughter: “Why does your husband feel badly?” Then she said to her father:
“He says he is homesick for his mother and his sister.” Then he was going to let him
go home with his daughter.
</p>
<p>Now he said: “Two canoes are lying at the end of the town. Have them launched for
yourselves.” At once they launched two canoes in front of the house, and they began
to put things, with which the inside of the house was full, into them. Before they
had taken even a little the canoes were filled. Then she went in one and her husband
in the other. Although there were no paddlers the canoes went along.
</p>
<p>He came to his father’s town long after they had ceased to think of him. Hu hu hu
hu hu, his father’s town moved at once. Then they carried the things up into his father’s
house. And then they sliced up the things he brought in sacks. He traded with this
property. He became a great chief. It consisted in food of all kinds such as is found
at low tide.
</p>
<p>At that time his children, who had grown large, came in to him. Then he took a slice
of food, cut it in two, and handed it to them, and they went out with it, the woman
also. Her husband lived more years among human beings than he had among the devilfish
people. With what he got by trading with the food her husband potlatched five times.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span></p>
<p>After he had lived there for some time he one day came to feel badly over something.
Right where he sat, in the back part of his father’s house, with his wife he began
to melt. She stretched her arms down between the planks. She pulled her head in after
them. Her husband was left sitting there. Afterward her husband also went in between
the planks. She went back to her father’s town. And they never saw them again.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Tom Stevens, chief of Those-born-at-House-point.]
</p>
<p>At the town of Skedans two own brothers fasted to become shamans. After they had fasted
for many years, the elder went out when the time came for them to go to bed. And,
when he entered, he said he had come in from lying with a woman. He was telling a
lie. He let him feel between his legs. It was wet [as if washed]. That was how he
fooled him. Then his younger brother also went out, but he really lay with a woman.
When day came, he lay dead.
</p>
<p>Then they put him into a box, and they placed him on a point,<a class="noteRef" id="n294.1src" href="#n294.1">1</a> and he (the second) kept crying near his younger brother. After he had sat there
for a while he heard the sound of a drum proceeding from the ocean. Presently it got
nearer. The canoe came in sight and landed bow<a class="noteRef" id="n294.2src" href="#n294.2">2</a> first in front of Skedans.
</p>
<p>Then two paddling in the bow wearing shamans’ hats<a class="noteRef" id="n294.3src" href="#n294.3">3</a> jumped off. And they went toward the light coming from the doorway of the house they
used to inhabit. They ran inside. They came back. When they got into their canoe they
turned around. “They are not in the house,” they said.
</p>
<p>And, when they started off, one saw where the body was laid. He said: “One of those
we spoke through lies there dead.” Then the two with shamans’ hats got off quickly
and took off the cover. He really lay there. His elder brother did not see that they
pulled off his skin.
</p>
<p>Then they went down to the canoe, and he got in with them. When they got in he got
into the stern. They did not see him. And with him they started seaward. Something
round hung from the armpit of the one who sat next to him. He saw that all had the
same.
</p>
<p>Then he squeezed that belonging to the one nearest to him strongly. He almost died
and acted as shaman for himself. When he blew<a class="noteRef" id="n294.4src" href="#n294.4">4</a> on himself he let it go. At once he sat up in the canoe. There was not the least
thing the matter with him.
</p>
<p>Then he moved slowly to the one in the middle and squeezed his also. Then he, too,
was about to die and acted as his own shaman. After he had blown on himself for a
while, he also let his go. The chief had his nest<a class="noteRef" id="n294.5src" href="#n294.5">5</a> in the middle. He sat in it.
</p>
<p>After he had done this to all in the canoe he also seized the chief’s. He, too, began
to die. His canoe companions acted as shamans for him. They blew upon him. But he
did not let his go. They tried to hurry each other. “Quick, paddle away with the chief
to get a shaman for him.”
</p>
<p>Then they landed, and they got shamans for him. And they acted around him, but he
squeezed it all the more. All the shamans could <span class="pageNum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>not heal him. Instead he squeezed it tighter. Then he began to die, and they said
“Quick, go and get the chief,” and they went for him.
</p>
<p>Then they went to get him, and they landed. But he was a great shaman, and, as soon
as he put his head in, he saw the one who had seized him. And he said to him: “Look
out for yourself, grandson. Those on the other side are not chiefs.”<a class="noteRef" id="n295.6src" href="#n295.6">6</a> He was chief among the shamans, they say. His name was Sîndjā′ña-i.
</p>
<p>And, when he began to perform around him, he slackened his hold. But, when another
shaman began to act around him he squeezed it harder, and he was dying. And, when
still another acted around him he squeezed it more again, and again he almost died.
</p>
<p>And, when the chief shaman again performed, he let go his hold. Then he got strong.
All the time he said the same thing to him: “Take care, grandson. They are not chiefs
on the other side.”<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n295.6asrc" href="#n295.6">6</a> And, when a different one performed around him he squeezed it harder, and he began
to die.
</p>
<p>Then he acted around him again, and they said to each other: “Give the chief whatever
he wants.” Then they brought a box from near the wall and took his younger brother’s
skin out of it. Not a part of it was lost. His finger-nails and toe-nails were all
there.
</p>
<p>Then they put it before the big shaman and turned over to him all kinds of property.
These and the human being he put inside of his blanket and went out. Immediately he
took him over to Skedans, and he gave him directions: “I will cause sickness at Skedans.
When one first falls sick and they do not get you, do not pay any attention to him.
He will die. And, when another is sick and they take property to you, save him. And,
when another is sick and they do not take you, pay no attention to him. He, too, will
die. When one again falls sick, you will receive two pieces of property. When another
falls sick, yours will become three, then four. It will increase until you receive
ten pieces. When there are many sick, every time one falls sick they will go for you
alone. On the other side they are not chiefs.”
</p>
<p>Then they landed, and he put his younger brother’s skin on him. He became alive. And
what he told him happened. When many fell sick they employed him only. In exchange
for what he got he became a chief. With it he potlatched.

<p class="first center">[Told by Job Moody of the Witch people.]
</p>
<p>Mouse-woman adopted him.<a class="noteRef" id="n296.1src" href="#n296.1">1</a> Presently, after she had lived at Skidegate for a while, supernatural powers began
to try him. After some time he began to be a shaman. By and by he became a real shaman.
</p>
<p>Then he prepared to dance upon the surface of the ocean. He was going out after whales.
Then they began to observe the regulations.<a class="noteRef" id="n296.2src" href="#n296.2">2</a> [They did so for] five nights. The old people were afraid to let it become ten nights.
If the number of nights were even, they said his supernatural power would be spoiled.
For that reason they said they wanted it uneven. When some said there were ten nights,
and some, too, said there were nine, the supernatural power came through him.
</p>
<p>Then he asked them for his name. “What kind of supernatural being am I?” he said.
Then they guessed at his name. By and by an old man said: “Great shaman, you are Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea.”<a class="noteRef" id="n296.3src" href="#n296.3">3</a> Then he jumped up and ran around the fire four times. And he named himself as follows:
“I am he, grandson. I am he.”
</p>
<p>While he was speaking through him he said to him: “How many whales are there going
to be?” He said to him: “One floats at Point-tꜝā′łᴀs.”<a class="noteRef" id="n296.4src" href="#n296.4">4</a> And he said to him, “One is floating below Ku′nga-i.”<a class="noteRef" id="n296.5src" href="#n296.5">5</a> Then he (the shaman) looked there and the whale floated there. Then he sent a person
thither. He saw nothing. Only coots floated there. And, since he did not find it there,
he (the shaman) again looked, and it was still floating there. Then he became angry,
because he (the spirit) kept fooling him.
</p>
<p>Now he put tobacco into his mouth. After it he put in calcined shells. Then he went
down to the house of Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea.
And he entered his house. And Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea
said to him: “Big-tail, bring that box of mine to me.” Then he put his box before
him. They sat at either end.
</p>
<p>Then he took out a dancing hat with sea gulls carved upon it. And at the very edges
of the box Big-tail stopped him as he held it. And he asked Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea:
“What will happen when one sings for it?”<a class="noteRef" id="n296.6src" href="#n296.6">6</a> And he said to him: “There will be two whales.” Then he absolutely refused it.
</p>
<p>And he reached his hand into the box for another one. When he <span class="pageNum" id="pb297">[<a href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>took that out he also seized that. “What will happen when you sing for it?” “There
will be two whales.” That, too, he refused.
</p>
<p>Then Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea became angry. Now
he said to him: “This he also refuses. What can you do, Big-tail? I will destroy you
with a strong current of water.” And he said to him: “Let it flow at me. Human beings
will laugh at you.”
</p>
<p>And, when they talked well to each other again, he took another out. While they yet
held this one between them, he saw it was a chief’s dancing headdress with the carving
of a hawk upon it.<a class="noteRef" id="n297.7src" href="#n297.7">7</a> And he reached right into the box for it. And they held it between them in the box.
</p>
<p>Then he again asked him: “What will happen when one sings for it?” And he said to
him: “There will be ten whales.” He also refused that. While they held the dancing
hat between them, some handsome persons with curly hair over their foreheads and large
eyes kept coming out from behind the screens and going back again. He wanted them
and pointed at them. “Let those persons sing.” And he refused to give them away. All
that time he also held the dance hat. By and by he let him have [these along with]
the headdress. Then they struck the two persons on the nose and pushed them out.
</p>
<p>In that house he learned how to tie on the strings of the headdress. When he had finished
learning how the flicker feathers were going to be placed upon it, he went away from
him again.
</p>
<p>Then he imitated the headdress. And, when it was finished, he danced with it on. And
he began to say: “The sea otter will come floating.” And he said: “One is floating
on the seaward side of Sqai′­yas.”<a class="noteRef" id="n297.8src" href="#n297.8">8</a> Then they went to get it. It was really floating there. As he had seen already, blood
was running out of its nose. After that, as he sat in the house, he told them where
another one was floating. And when they went there it was really so.
</p>
<p>Afterward they kept on being found in this way. When one was out in a good place where
currents met, he did not count whether there were fifteen, twenty, or ten.<a class="noteRef" id="n297.9src" href="#n297.9">9</a> Then he said if they would give him and his mother some of them, he would always
have them found floating in this way.
</p>
<p>Then they began finding whales in the place where he had told them there were whales,
although they had not found them. They now found them, although he did not say [again]
that they were there.<a class="noteRef" id="n297.10src" href="#n297.10">10</a> They ceased getting sea otter.
</p>
<p>Afterward, when he had acted as a shaman does for a while, he said: “I wonder what
is going on in the house of Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea.
I wonder why a drum sounds.” Then he chewed tobacco and said he would go down and
see. And he fell asleep. After he had slept for a while, tcōxō′xō (noise of waking
<span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>up) [was heard],<a class="noteRef" id="n298.11src" href="#n298.11">11</a> and he called to his wife. He had married a woman he owned (i.e., a slave). “Middle,<a class="noteRef" id="n298.12src" href="#n298.12">12</a> help me to sit up.” Then she pulled him up.
</p>
<p>And, after he had sat there looking unhappy for a while, he said: “Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea
is going to give a feast. The drum sounded because they are practicing songs. He is
going to invite all the supernatural beings. I will go down again and look on.”
</p>
<p>Some time after that his drum sounded again, he said, and he went down to him again.
Then he entered his door, and Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea
said to him, “Big-tail, I am going to invite the supernatural beings to a feast. Come
and sit near me so that we may both look on.” Invitation had already been sent out.
</p>
<p>After some time had passed, they began to come in. At that time he put Big-tail in
his armpit. The killer whales came in through the doorway. The ends of their dorsal
fins touched the roof of the house. And, where they were to sit, they came out of
their skins and sat.
</p>
<p>After they had continued to come in in this way for a while, a certain one who had
to cramp his fins to enter came in and sat down.
</p>
<p>After that the house creaked. A strong current flowed in through the doorway. In it
a great amount of seaweed was mingled. Through the doorway there also came a black
cloud. Rain blew on their faces. All the supernatural beings held their heads down.
Some time afterward a small being stood up where it had been. He wore a four-crowned
dancing hat. And he began to ask them: “What will you do with human beings? Are you
going to save the human beings?” Then there were again black showers. Snow also fell
about the house. And he again stood in his place. And he again asked them what was
going to be done with the human beings. Then there were again black clouds. Hailstones
also flew about the house and into their faces. Again the supernatural beings held
their heads down. And he stood up in place of these and went in where he was to sit.
Nothing happened. That was South-east, they say.<a class="noteRef" id="n298.13src" href="#n298.13">13</a>
</p>
<p>During that time Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea held
him in his armpit. He let him look at the supernatural beings. But the supernatural
beings did not know it.
</p>
<p>As before the house began to shake. Presently the feet of someone appeared coming
in through the doorway. After some time had passed he stepped in, and the house shook.
Then the supernatural beings said: “A”. He took a step with the other foot. Something
with large, broad eyelids entered. Nothing happened.
</p>
<p>Some time after that something came along making a rattling noise. By and by she came
in with a crowd of female servants. Djila′qons<a class="noteRef" id="n298.14src" href="#n298.14">14</a> it was who came in among them. She had her eyebrows painted with <span class="pageNum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>red paint. They entered. Something about her sounded like a rattle. Big-tail kept
his eyes upon her all the time.
</p>
<p>But Woman-sitting-and-smelling<a class="noteRef" id="n299.15src" href="#n299.15">15</a> walked in before her. After having sat there for a while she raised herself up. She
began to talk to Djila′qons. She asked her why she had painted her eyebrows red, and
Djila′qons answered: “I had it done on your account.” Then she turned toward the wall
and wiped it off. And she turned toward the fire and sat down.
</p>
<p>Some time after they say that Pestilence<a class="noteRef" id="n299.16src" href="#n299.16">16</a> came in. His canoe was like a white man’s vessel. Sparks flew out of it. They went
through the house. For that reason the supernatural beings were afraid. The things
that came out of it are what cause sickness. The supernatural beings feared they would
strike them. He refused to enter. He went back.
</p>
<p>Then the nephew of Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea went
out and said: “You are not the only one who has supernatural power. I have supernatural
power. My uncle also has supernatural power. So you better not come in.” Then he (the
nephew) entered, and, when he untied a little something against the roof of the house,
which was like a hollow tube closed with knots at both ends, Pestilence’s canoe was
quickly turned about. Then he said he would enter. “I will go in.” Presently he entered.
Nothing happened. [They say it was Tidal-wave<a class="noteRef" id="n299.17src" href="#n299.17">17</a> who owned that.] All that time a space was left vacant in the rear of the house.
No one sat there. By and by the one who came in first sang. And, after he had finished
singing, he acted with a mask on from behind the screen they had stretched across.
After he had acted with the mask on for a while, it split crosswise<a class="noteRef" id="n299.18src" href="#n299.18">18</a> on his face, and snow came out of it in a broad sheet. Then it fell first by the
vacant seat. After that it fell in front of the chief’s house. And after that his
face also split vertically.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n299.18asrc" href="#n299.18">18</a> Out of the split the same substance fell. That was property, they say.
</p>
<p>Big-tail was guessing. “I guess it is he on whom we live [for whom the vacant space
is left]. It is for The-one-below.”<a class="noteRef" id="n299.19src" href="#n299.19">19</a>
</p>
<p>The next one who came in also started to sing. Afterward he also came out from behind
the screen wearing a mask. After they had sung a “Power-song” for him a while and
put words into it, his face also split open. Something white and broad fell down around
the house in front of the chiefs. Again it fell first by the vacant seat. When they
put words into it again it split vertically. Then it again fell first by the vacant
seat. After that it fell in front of the chiefs.
</p>
<p>All the supernatural beings did the same thing. Sometimes one stood up with his fins
on. In that way the sleight-of-hand performances went on.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb300">[<a href="#pb300">300</a>]</span></p>
<p>After some time had passed Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea
also began to dance. Then he made a good speech to the supernatural beings, after
which he also sang. When he had got through singing he, too, came out wearing a big
mask. He also wore a big fin. When they put words into the power song his mask also
split. Out of that, too, something white fell. Some fell first by the vacant seat.
Then they stopped singing the power song.
</p>
<p>There was a great pile of property for those in the house. Before they entered their
provisions came rolling in before them through the door. They had two [boxes] or,
if chiefs, four. Now they began to eat. It was a whale. And they cut it around and
around right from its head and stretched it around in front of the supernatural beings.
They spliced another to that also, and then they all began to eat.<a class="noteRef" id="n300.20src" href="#n300.20">20</a> After all had eaten for some time they stopped. All the big beings went off.
</p>
<p>Then Big-tail also went to Skidegate. After he had performed for a time in the same
way as formerly, and, when they were starving, all began giving him the food they
had saved up. Cranberries, wild crabapples, sīg̣ā′n,<a class="noteRef" id="n300.21src" href="#n300.21">21</a> roots put up in cakes,<a class="noteRef" id="n300.22src" href="#n300.22">22</a> berries put up in cakes, and grease, they gave him. They gave these quietly to him
while he slept. There was also a quantity of Indian tobacco with them.
</p>
<p>And, after he had slept for a while, he spoke again in the same way as formerly, “Tcōxō′.<span class="corr" id="xd32e26271" title="Not in source">”</span><a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n300.11src" href="#n298.11">11</a> Then he got up carefully and gave away all off of the top into the fire.<a class="noteRef" id="n300.23src" href="#n300.23">23</a> Then he also spilled out fresh water around the fire. He gave these to Supernatural-being-at-whose-voice-the-ravens-sit-on-the-sea.
After that he ate all of it. That night he performed.
</p>
<p>And next day he said: “Go out to hunt.” Then they found a whale floated ashore near
by. And on account of that the Skidegate people ceased being hungry.
</p>
<p>Some time later Supernatural-being-people-always-go-to begged him to accompany him.
“Big-tail, go with me to see my elder brother.” And he did not know where he wanted
him to go. Then he went with him as he requested. Then he launched a square canoe,
he put Big-tail inside of his clothing, and they started off.
</p>
<p>They went, went, went for a while, after which they came in sight of something white
in the ocean like a mountain, and he let him look out at it. He said to him: “Big-tail,
there is the house of my elder brother,” whereupon a strong wind arose, and they returned.
They barely got home safe.
</p>
<p>Then they dried themselves around the fire in the house of Supernatural-being-people-always-go-to.
They talked with one another about it. He was among them. Then he said to him: “Big-tail,
when another good day comes, come to go with me again.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some time afterward he went to his town again. And, when he entered, he asked him:
“Big-tail, will you go with me again?” “Yes,” he said to him. At once they started
off again. After they had paddled seaward for a while he said his house had again
come in sight. He let him look out. In truth his great white house appeared at intervals
over the waves. And again a strong wind arose from the house. It drove them back again.
</p>
<p>And, when they again got into the house, he called to him: “Big-tail, do not go with
me again. My elder brother refuses to let you see the inside of his house. That is
why the wind is high for us. Do not go with me again.” That was the only one among
the supernatural beings whose house he was unable to see. His name was “Chief.”<a class="noteRef" id="n301.24src" href="#n301.24">24</a>
</p>
<p>Some time after he got back Yä′yū<a class="noteRef" id="n301.25src" href="#n301.25">25</a> spoke through him. He made things happen by speaking through him. Four whales floated
about. He did the same thing to him as the neighboring supernatural being had done.
“Let me go, for I want to see why a drum sounds in the house of Supernatural-being-looking-landward
(another name for Yä′yū).”
</p>
<p>Then he lay down. He lay there for a while and entered his house. Then some persons,
with their fins together, stirred up soapberries in something made of great boards
painted on the outside, they used to say.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n301.25asrc" href="#n301.25">25</a> They looked like Peninsula-point<a class="noteRef" id="n301.26src" href="#n301.26">26</a> soapberries, yet they were different. Now he came home.
</p>
<p>He spoke through him for a while longer. Then he became lame. And, after he had sat
in the house for a while, he said: “Let me go down to see why a drum is sounding in
the house of Supernatural-being-looking-landward.” Then he chewed tobacco, lay down,
and continued there for a while.
</p>
<p>Now, when he entered his house, Supernatural-being-looking-landward said to him: “I
am glad to see you, Big-tail.” In those words he said he was glad to see him. At this
time they raised up the stuff they were stirring up with a stick, and it stuck to
it. Before he had eaten of that he went up, and, when he awoke, he said: “Why did
I come away so soon? I ought to have eaten whale tongue with them.”
</p>
<p>After he had sat there for another space of time, he said: “I wonder why a drum has
been sounding in the house of Supernatural-being-looking-landward. Let me go down
again.”
</p>
<p>Then he chewed tobacco, and, while he lay there, he got into his house. Even while
he was in the doorway he called to him: “Wait, Big-tail, you better not go up from
me. I will invite the supernatural beings.”
</p>
<p>Immediately he invited the people. They came in at once. When all got in he began
to dance before them. They who came in wore <span class="pageNum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>fins. He dressed himself up and came in, and lay down in the rear of the house, wearing
a full killer-whale suit. His fins touched the roof of the house. Then he came out
of it, and, as he held it in his hands, he said: “Real dorsal fin. Real dorsal fin.
What human beings call in a common way a dorsal fin (łg̣ᴀn). Real dorsal fin.” After
he had stood around a while, he said: “Human beings keep saying this about me. They
keep saying that I used to be a human being.”<a class="noteRef" id="n302.27src" href="#n302.27">27</a> All in the house laughed at him. It was as if things moved the house.
</p>
<p>Now they began eating what they had stirred up. They say they were whales’ tongues.
Now, when this was over, the coast between Skidegate inlet and House-point<a class="noteRef" id="n302.28src" href="#n302.28">28</a> was strewn with whale jaws which had floated ashore. The things they ate in the house
of Supernatural-being-looking-landward really floated ashore.
</p>
<p>A long time after that they again began to starve. And there was nothing to eat at
Skidegate. Then they took him to Da′x̣ua<a class="noteRef" id="n302.29src" href="#n302.29">29</a>, and they lived there with him. And they were starving there. Then they gathered
edible fern stumps right behind them. Those they ate. They hunted outward and inward.<a class="noteRef" id="n302.30src" href="#n302.30">30</a> Sometimes one found the body of a coot. They ate all these things.
</p>
<p>One time he performed all night. Then Supernatural-being-looking-landward said to
him: “Big-tail, have them stop making the little supernatural women living along the
shore cry.<a class="noteRef" id="n302.31src" href="#n302.31">31</a> Say that I will give the human beings something.”
</p>
<p>And next day he repeated it to the people. “Let no one go anywhere. Supernatural-being-looking-landward
says he will give some food to the human beings.” But still they all went out to look
for food again up and down the inlet.
</p>
<p>That night he again sang a song for himself. In the night the wind blew in from the
sea. At daybreak he stopped singing. The day after that one went out very early. Astonishing!
He came in and he said, “Get up quickly. It lies near Eagle-rock.<a class="noteRef" id="n302.32src" href="#n302.32">32</a> Astonishing!” All moved at once. He did not eat of it because he was a shaman. Now
they were saved. They stopped starving.
</p>
<p>At that time the slaves at Skidegate starved to death. Then a man of the Seaward-sqoā′ładas
set snares at ʟā′stᴀlañ<a class="noteRef" id="n302.33src" href="#n302.33">33</a> for cormorants. His slaves alone did not die. Then one tried to set snares near him,
and he refused to have him there. He obeyed and went off. He was named Gū′stas. He
killed people by means of witchcraft. That is why they did what he told them to.
</p>
<p>After another long space of time had elapsed, Welcome-point’s<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n302.5src" href="#n296.5">5</a> son spoke through him. He put words into his song inside of his father’s house. He
sang to get his father’s things he had promised. He was unsuccessful. He sang for
the spring salmon his father owns. He was unable to get them. His father was stingy.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now an old man in the house said: “The chief’s son would do it if he could. Even I
will put out a few sea-eggs.” The first time he promised not the least thing happened.
Because the old man said he would put out a little, they had more sea-eggs than they
needed in Skidegate inlet.
</p>
<p>Some time after this people went to Skedans, and he wanted to go with them; and he
went. And he arrived there with them. And the day after they went to ʟi′nsū,<a class="noteRef" id="n303.34src" href="#n303.34">34</a> and he went with them. Then they landed at Kꜝū′dᴀsʟꜝxa,<a class="noteRef" id="n303.35src" href="#n303.35">35</a> and he crept ashore. Then he lay in the sunshine.
</p>
<p>Then they said to him: “Hurry, Big-tail, and come.” And he entered the house of Ku′ndjîgit.<a class="noteRef" id="n303.36src" href="#n303.36">36</a> “Is it you, Big-tail?” And he said it was, and he was glad to see him. And now he
saw the inside of his house. He saw whale tails lying piled one over another in all
four corners. He was proud of the inside of his house. He had the most whales of all
the supernatural beings. That is why he showed it to him. He did not speak through
him.
</p>
<p class="small">This story is one of the most important for an understanding of shamanism among the
Haida. The word used for “tail” here is applied to the tail of a fish or whale, and
the word for “big,” qō′na, also involves the idea of great power.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o, to whom it was related by an old man
of Ninstints]
</p>
<p>At Middle-town<a class="noteRef" id="n305.1src" href="#n305.1">1</a> Łᴀ′gua spoke through a certain one. After he had acted as shaman for a time, while
they sang for him, he began to whip something. At once he began to fast. All that
time he whipped it. The town people wanted to see it. They wanted to see the thing
he spoke about.<a class="noteRef" id="n305.2src" href="#n305.2">2</a>
</p>
<p>After a while he sang that he held his supernatural power, Łᴀ′gua, in his teeth at
the end of the town. His supernatural power also made the water smooth for some time.
All that time they fished for black cod. Every time they came in from fishing those
who handled the lines gave him two black cod. His wife had a great quantity.
</p>
<p>By and by Łᴀ′gua told him to go out fishing with them. He went with them at once.
After they had fished for black cod for a while and had started away, they came to
a point of iron sticking out of the water. Then the shaman sat upon it.<a class="noteRef" id="n305.3src" href="#n305.3">3</a> And he gave them directions. “Go in, and then come out to meet me,” he said to him.
</p>
<p>As soon as they had unloaded their black cod, they went out to meet him. It was evening.
They called out to one another. Then they approached each other. When they called
out after it had become dark he answered them. At once they went to him. Immediately
all the canoes began to tow it ashore. They used a black-cod fish-line for the purpose.
</p>
<p>After they had paddled for a while, it became broad daylight, and they towed it in
at the end of the town. It was only for Those-born-at-Sa′ki.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n305.1asrc" href="#n305.1">1</a>
</p>
<p>After they were through eating they began to split off iron wedges. When they got
through with that they began to hammer out the iron. They made spears and knives of
it. The news of this iron passed over the island. At once people started to come for
the iron. They exchanged a slave for one piece of iron. They kept selling it. They
worked this into war spears throughout all of the villages.
</p>
<p>After they had traded with this iron for a while, Inlet people<a class="noteRef" id="n305.4src" href="#n305.4">4</a> came in ten canoes. After they had been there for a while, news came from the towns
up the inlet that they would try to make trouble for them during the gambling. Then
the Middle-town people said they would not let them do it at their town. They were
on the side of the Inlet people. Secretly they made different arrangements. They deceived
[their visitors] by saying they were on their side.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb306">[<a href="#pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>One morning they came to gamble. As soon as they landed they spread out their gambling
mats. They formed a line on the side toward the sea. The Middle-town people told the
Inlet people not to be afraid. At once they began to gamble. And after the town people
had put on their weapons they stood behind them. They held their spears, and they
held their knives.
</p>
<p>After they had talked for a while over the betting and had begun to gamble they stood
with their spear points upward. Then they turned around at once and speared all. They
killed all. The others did not scratch a skin in return. All their wives and their
children who were in the houses they enslaved. Not one escaped.
</p>
<p>Then the news that they had destroyed them went over this island and the news also
reached the Inlet.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n306.4src" href="#n305.4">4</a>
</p>
<p>After that one for whom they were going to get a grave post slept alone. His mother-in-law,
who was a widow, stayed with him. When winter came he told them to make a pole in
the shape of a killer whale’s dorsal fin, the lower part with the carving of a grizzly
bear upon it. He belonged to the Slaves.<a class="noteRef" id="n306.5src" href="#n306.5">5</a>
</p>
<p>At once they went out to get it. They came to tell him. They pulled it ashore, and,
after they had carved it for a while, it was finished. And the day before the one
on which they were to raise the grave post he pounded up tobacco and gave it to a
shaman there.
</p>
<p>Then his supernatural power entered him. They sang for him. Very soon he got through.
Then he said: “There are many eyes of strangers upon me. Over there, too, lies my
trunk.”
</p>
<p>Now it was night. In the night the Inlet people came to the town and killed all the
people. They enslaved all the women and the children. All the time that he who got
the grave post was supposed to be sleeping alone he was in love with his mother-in-law.
His name was “Sealion’s-neck.”
</p>
<p class="small">Łᴀ′gua was a Tlingit spirit, and there were several stories told about him. The following
was taken down by me in English:
</p>
<p class="small">Łᴀ′gua once “came through” a Tlingit. He was a poor man, but his Power told him that
some day he would be rich. By and by enemies came and carried him off as a slave.
While he was still a slave, his Power came to him again, and told him that he would
be a chief. He said: “No, how can I be a chief, when I am a slave sitting near the
door? You better stop talking to me.” “No, by and by you shall be a chief.” He was
a slave for five or six years, and during all of that time his Power kept promising
him that he should be a chief. One night, when he was acting as a shaman, his Power
threw something called Lā′nas ya′mᴀg̣a, which makes people love each other, on the
whole village, and everyone fell into a deep sleep. Then he and some of his fellow
slaves filled two canoes with children whom they were going to enslave, and the canoes
went off without a paddle being used. Long after day came the parents awoke and pursued,
but, when the pursuers came near them, the slaves’ canoes became islands covered with
trees, and they were passed by. When the pursuers passed on their way back, the same
thing happened again. Finally he reached his own town and, from the sale of the children
he had taken off and from <span class="pageNum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>the property received from the relatives of the slaves he had liberated, he became
a great chief.

<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsgo]
</p>
<p>A Tlingit supernatural power spoke through him. After he had acted as shaman for a
while, and, when all were at Tꜝā′łdi, the son of the chief of the salmon spoke through
him. At that time there were no salmon on this island. Then the salmon came like a
strong wind.
</p>
<p>At that time he used to go into a deep place. His moose-skin blankets had pictures
of salmon on them. He also wore a dance hat. He had a dancing skirt. He had rattles
of puffin beaks.
</p>
<p>At that time the chiefs refused to allow him [to go down]. They told him he would
swim away forever. Then he became disgusted, so they said the salmon would be lost,
and they let him go down. They let one who was always truthful go with him.
</p>
<p>Then they sang for him in the way he told them. “When I go down, do not stop singing
the spirit song until I get back.” Just at evening he prepared to go, and, after he
had danced around the fire for a while, he went down. Immediately Lā′ma<a class="noteRef" id="n308.1src" href="#n308.1">1</a> went after him. After he had gone they sang for him, and he went into a deep place.
</p>
<p>Then he lay still in the creek like a dog salmon. Lā′ma thought he would swim away,
and he held the lower edge of his moose-skin blanket in his hand. After he had stayed
in the water for a while, he jerked like a dog salmon sending out eggs. After he had
done this four times he stood up. He was not wet in a single spot. All that time they
sang for him in the house.
</p>
<p>Then there were great numbers of dog salmon in the creek. When he stood up in the
house all looked at him. He was not wet in the least. Then dog salmon nearly surrounded
the coasts of this island. Before that there were few salmon, but a strong man dried
three dog salmon during a season. The strongest man got five. They put two away, and,
taking one along as provisions, they spent the winter in the neighborhood of mussels.
</p>
<p>He had them get a large drum off of the east side of a big cedar. They used to hang
that up.
</p>
<p>After that Sᴀqaiyū′ł<a class="noteRef" id="n308.2src" href="#n308.2">2</a> spoke through Cloud-watcher at Łg̣ō′gi. When his voice came through him he ran into
the sea. Then he started around the town begging. He came into a house and held out
his blanket. “Djū x̣undâ′-î.”<a class="noteRef" id="n308.3src" href="#n308.3">3</a> They did not understand his words. By and by in one house he entered Djat-gitcꜝî′ñgaga
guessed what he meant and put five plugs [of tobacco] into his blanket. At once all
in the town gave to him. They each gave him five plugs.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some time after this they were all at Sea-grass town.<a class="noteRef" id="n309.4src" href="#n309.4">4</a> Then there was much sickness. And an old woman went to the end of Sea-grass Town.
Then she held her hands up. She wanted Power-of-the-shining-heavens<a class="noteRef" id="n309.5src" href="#n309.5">5</a> to look upon her. From above they saw what she did.
</p>
<p>After that, when autumn came, three towns were gathered together at ʟgakîtsgalā′ña.<a class="noteRef" id="n309.6src" href="#n309.6">6</a> They were there on account of A′nkustᴀ.<a class="noteRef" id="n309.7src" href="#n309.7">7</a>
</p>
<p>After that, when they went to get provisions, a Town-of-Djī′gua<a class="noteRef" id="n309.8src" href="#n309.8">8</a> man named Waters became a shaman at Łg̣ā′g̣a.<a class="noteRef" id="n309.9src" href="#n309.9">9</a> At once they built a large house for dancing. All the time they were dancing there
he did not mention his name. He was left-handed. He held a club on the left side.
On his right side he held a war knife, wearing it point outward. They sang for him.
He also had a grizzly bear head.
</p>
<p>After they had sung a while for him he ceased to use these things and wore different
ones. At once he again stood up for the dance. After this dance had gone on for a
while there, they came to Sea-grass town.
</p>
<p>After the dance had gone on at Sea-grass town for a while, he told them where an eagle
was sitting. He foretold that there would be two blue feathers on either side of its
tail. At once they went to get it, and, when they had got it, although they did not
speak to him, where he lay in the house he struck the roof in his joy. Then he mentioned
his two names. “I am Wu′ltcꜝixaiya. I am Ūdagiā′g̣ᴀñ.” That was the Moon’s youngest
grandchild.<a class="noteRef" id="n309.10src" href="#n309.10">10</a>
</p>
<p>When they went to <span class="corr" id="xd32e26500" title="Source: Metlakatla">Metlakahtla</span> to gamble he became angry with one opposite him, and, when he stood up, he became
ten. For that reason his elder brothers were afraid of him.
</p>
<p>Because they had mercy upon the one who held up her hands, he (the Moon’s son) came
down to Sea-grass town. He still had the eagle in his possession and used the bone
club and the knife. At that time He-with-only-one-fin<a class="noteRef" id="n309.11src" href="#n309.11">11</a> talked to him. “Chief, I know you. You are Ha′ostī. The people are afraid of the
things you use. The chiefs’ sons among the people, when they dance, use good rattles.”
At that time he stopped using the knife and the club. His words pleased him. He held
a puffin-beak rattle and a large rattle in his hands. On the left side he also held
a chief’s rattle. He began to act in two different ways.
</p>
<p>When he first started to perform they sang a spirit song for him: 𝄆&nbsp;Gilâ′dᴀm ga′dani
gia â gīlâ&nbsp;𝄇 𝄆&nbsp;âmaiyâ ga wīnâxnôx nâ gaa&nbsp;𝄇.<a class="noteRef" id="n309.12src" href="#n309.12">12</a> Before they sang he sang alone. “Who is the great supernatural power?” This is the
spirit song that they used to sing for him. At this time, after he had acted as shaman
for a while, he stopped using those articles.
</p>
<p>And he also used to wear fine cedar bark hanging from around his neck. He held one
end of these hanging in a bunch over the fire and then acted as a shaman. Then burning
coals flew round upon them. At once they began to dance. All wore fine cedar bark
hanging <span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>down from their necks. They had two strings of it around their arms. They also had
some around their heads. On top of this [small] trees were stuck in. They used to
dance with these. 𝄆&nbsp;“Yâ hô ē ahēhaiya&nbsp;𝄇 come hither great power.”<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n310.12src" href="#n309.12">12</a> They all danced, singing this.
</p>
<p>They came in dancing. Then, when they came in, he looked at them from where he stood
in the rear of the house. He looked to see if anyone were sick. If one smiled a little,
he said: “The people have untroubled minds.”
</p>
<p>While that was still going on, summer came. When they were going off to the lonely
places (i.e., camps) he started to sing another song.<a class="noteRef" id="n310.13src" href="#n310.13">13</a> This was the song. When he got through singing he stood up, and he said: “People,
you are safe. Wherever you go in your canoes, sing this song. You are safe.” He came
down and helped them. While he (the spirit) was still speaking in him (the man), he
died.
</p>
<p>Here is all of this.
</p>
<p id="ch3.23.n" class="small">The name Cloud-watcher occurs in one other place, in “The story about Him who destroyed
his nine nephews.” He belonged to the Town-of-Djī′gua people, an important Eagle family

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsgo.]
</p>
<p>G̣ᴀ′ndox’s father was making a canoe inland from one end of Sea-grass town.<a class="noteRef" id="n311.1src" href="#n311.1">1</a> One evening, when he came home, he dropped dead<a class="noteRef" id="n311.2src" href="#n311.2">2</a> on the sand at the end of the town. Then they ran to him, and carried him over to
his house.
</p>
<p>Qołdai′yêk<a class="noteRef" id="n311.3src" href="#n311.3">3</a> spoke through him first. Whenever his uncles became shamans, he always made a hole
in their minds first. He did not tell his name. Instead he turned about around the
house. After they had taken him in and came to know that it was Qołdai′yêk, they began
to sing a song for him. After they had carried him around the fire four times he began
turning around.
</p>
<p>Afterward Hū′dᴀgiag̣ᴀñ also spoke through him. He acted like the former one. When
he had ceased to act Sᴀqaiyū′ł<a class="noteRef" id="n311.4src" href="#n311.4">4</a> spoke through him. When they sang for him he walked about entirely on the ends of
his toes.
</p>
<p>After he had spoken through him for a while, a certain person fell sick. When he was
almost dead they got him. Then he fasted four nights. At the end of that time, just
before daybreak, he went out to look for his soul. Two other persons went with him.
He went round the town on both sides of the houses. By and by he seized his soul.
He made a noise like that of a young sea otter.
</p>
<p>At once his companions seized him and carried him toward the house. When they carried
them (shamans) so, they were very careful, because the shaman had the soul between
his hands.
</p>
<p>While they were carrying him along the trail, a Smaller-part-of-village’s-stomach<a class="noteRef" id="n311.5src" href="#n311.5">5</a> came out of the ground. Then Sᴀqaiyū′ł said to him: “Get it, master. Throw the man’s
soul away.” “No, I am afraid they would laugh at me. I am also afraid of being put
to shame.” Then Sᴀqaiyū′ł said to him: “You will not sit among the chiefs in the rear
of the house. You will sit among the slaves near the door.”
</p>
<p>All that time they were singing for him in the house he had left. Presently, after
they had carried him into the house, they put a mat over him and the sick man. There
he put his soul into his mouth. Immediately he was saved.
</p>
<p>Pestilence<a class="noteRef" id="n311.6src" href="#n311.6">6</a> married one of the daughters<a class="noteRef" id="n311.7src" href="#n311.7">7</a> of the Moon. When he heard the news about his sister in some way, Wu′ltcꜝixaiya<a class="noteRef" id="n311.8src" href="#n311.8">8</a> went to get his sister. He put on a steel coat and launched his canoe. His canoe
was covered with boards. Then he knocked down the rock <span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>front of the house of Pestilence with a bone club. Afterward he went in and got his
sister. For that reason there was much sickness.
</p>
<p>Then Wu′ltcꜝixaiya had mercy on Sea-grass town and went down there along with Dilᴀgiâ′.<a class="noteRef" id="n312.9src" href="#n312.9">9</a> When many people were dying he (Dilᴀgiâ′) went in to dance before Pestilence. He
held a long cane the surface of which was painted red. He stuck it up slantwise, stood
upon it, and danced. Then he made him feel good, and the sickness ceased. He spoke
through Gᴀ′ndox’s father. Then he told him these things. Sᴀqaiyū′ł stopped speaking
through him.
</p>
<p>After he had spoken through him for a while, he wanted some turnips, and all in the
town gave him some. Through these he became more of a chief in the country of the
supernatural beings. When his (Dilᴀgiâ′’s) voice first struck him, he sang in all
the houses of the town for himself. After that he went into his own house. He was
also always dancing there. “Yâ â â yâ â′aiya nagun dâ â hai i ya Dīlagiâ ahai i yâ.”<a class="noteRef" id="n312.10src" href="#n312.10">10</a> This is what they sang when he danced. It is a spirit song.
</p>
<p>After that one of the Pebble-town people<a class="noteRef" id="n312.11src" href="#n312.11">11</a> came to invite them. Then one through whom Property-woman<a class="noteRef" id="n312.12src" href="#n312.12">12</a> spoke came by himself in a canoe. At that time Dilᴀgiâ′ told him he had stretched
some bad thing (or spirit) over the town. Then he danced before him.<a class="noteRef" id="n312.13src" href="#n312.13">13</a> And he made him feel good<span class="corr" id="xd32e26621" title="Source: ,">.</span>
</p>
<p>Some time after this, after they had gone to the mainland, a different one spoke through
him. His name was Bᴀlê′la.<a class="noteRef" id="n312.14src" href="#n312.14">14</a> Then they returned to Sea-grass town with him. Then they sang for Gᴀ′ndox’s<span class="corr" id="xd32e26631" title="Source: -"> </span>father in the canoe. He danced as they came. And when they landed he asked for a plank
in the Tsimshian language. Then they had one rest on the edges of the canoe. He came
down upon it to the shore.<a class="noteRef" id="n315.15src" href="#n315.15">15</a>
</p>
<p>And, when he got into the house, the house cover only was open (i.e., it was crowded
with people). He danced the way Wu′ltcꜝixaiya used to. When he began to dance he was
proud, and he had himself pulled upright. After that was done he began to dance.
</p>
<p>After he had danced for a while he would say: “Stop and throw away the cedar-bark
roofing. Destroy also the indoor latrine. Use cedar planks for your houses. When you
go to bed leave your smoke holes open. Boxes of property will soon fall upon you.
Iron people<a class="noteRef" id="n315.16src" href="#n315.16">16</a> will come among you.” He said that. He said there would be plenty of property for
them.
</p>
<p>Then all in the town danced very much again. The Kitkatla people also brought over
Bī′ni’s<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n315.14src" href="#n312.14">14</a> songs to Skedans. They sang his also very much as they danced. At this time a schooner
was wrecked [in Cumshewa inlet]. Then blankets were gradually distributed in quantities.
This went on for a long time. Then, according to his word, they used cedar planks
for house roofs. They also stopped using indoor latrines.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb313">[<a href="#pb313">313</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he wanted fire drills. Now all the town people gave fire drills to him. When
they came in with them he let them all drill together. Then he looked on. After all
had done the same thing they put them into the fire. That was why he had them give
them to himself.
</p>
<p>When they stopped dancing they waved their hats. He sang a song. When all stopped
he whistled. Then they stopped singing his [song, which sounded like this]: “Tcô′lōhô′ldīdôlgîts.”<a class="noteRef" id="n313.17src" href="#n313.17">17</a>
</p>
<p>Afterward Sᴀqaiyū′ł again spoke through him. And, after the dancing had gone on a
while longer, he wanted to sleep. At that time the Sea-grass town chiefs would not
let him. By and by, since they feared the supernatural beings might say something
different from what they wanted if they refused, they let him sleep.
</p>
<p>When they agreed they made a sail house<a class="noteRef" id="n313.18src" href="#n313.18">18</a> for him in the corner. And just at evening he went in and lay down. Next day, very
early, before the raven cried he awoke (lit., departed). After that they again came
in dancing. When they stopped dancing he had me sit near him. Then he began to tell
me quietly [what had happened].
</p>
<p>At that time he (Sᴀqaiyū′ł) stood on top of the mountain on Qꜝᴀ′ñga with him. Then
he took a handkerchief<a class="noteRef" id="n313.19src" href="#n313.19">19</a> out of his pocket, put it over his face, and wept. His clothes were all white. But
he had no coat. Something with wheels<a class="noteRef" id="n313.20src" href="#n313.20">20</a> stood near him, and presently he put him into his pocket on the right side. Then
he got into this, and he struck it. It went right along. After he had gone along slowly
he came to a city with him and took him out of his pocket. And he stood up.
</p>
<p>A big being with a black skin stood there. He also had a big gun. He stood pointing
it downward at the earth. Sᴀqaiyū′ł handed something to him out of his pocket. After
a while he took it without looking at him and put it into his mouth. He did not know
what it was. He thought it was Indian tobacco.
</p>
<p>Then Sᴀqaiyū′ł said to him: “Do not be afraid, master. Even the supernatural beings
die. Where my three sets of clothing hang up, I have lived a long time. I died three
times, but my body never dies.”
</p>
<p>When he went thither with him, he saw a large kettle boiling out of doors. He said
he did not see what made it boil. Near it was a long thing, the lower end of which
was square, on which the Kwakiutl who had killed a certain one along with a Haida
were nailed.<a class="noteRef" id="n313.21src" href="#n313.21">21</a> They had put them into the kettle. There they remained.
</p>
<p>There he saw his uncle. Then his uncle asked him: “Did you see the one standing there
with a black skin? He shoots down on those people below who treat each other badly.
Then the land below is also full of smoke, and there is sickness everywhere.”
</p>
<p>Then his uncle<a class="noteRef" id="n313.22src" href="#n313.22">22</a> spoke to him through the doorway. “Why are you here?” “Sᴀqaiyū′ł brought me around
in that thing.” “Be watchful. If one always watches, he, too, will live here. The
black man always keeps watch on those who are foolish.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb314">[<a href="#pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that time his uncle said to him: “Some time ago one came down through me. And he
lived in this town. Now he lives far inland. They fear to mention his name.” His uncle
talked with him for a while. Again he said to him: “Do not let his name be mentioned
again below. You can not mention his name [for it is too great]. If a child mentions
his name tell him to stop.”<a class="noteRef" id="n314.23src" href="#n314.23">23</a>
</p>
<p>Then he went down again with him in the thing with wheels. At that time he awoke in
the sail house. Not a long time afterward he died.
</p>
<p>This is the end of it.
</p>
<p class="small">This story is of exceptional interest, both from the insight it gives into native
beliefs generally and for the picture presented of the influence exerted on those
beliefs and over the external life of the people also by the coming of white men.
G̣ᴀ′ndox was evidently this shaman’s daughter, and the name appears to be Tsimshian.
After he became a shaman, however, he was known, as was customary, by the name of
the spirit who was speaking through him at the time. He belonged, like two of the
shamans in the preceding story, to the Town-of-Djī′gua-People of Old Kloo.
</p>
<p class="small">I was fortunate in having obtained information regarding this shaman from one who
knew him intimately, and to whom, it appears, he confided some of his spiritual experiences.
The shaman is well known to all Skidegate Haida, and many other stories are told regarding
his predictions. For some of these, see Memoirs of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition,
volume <span class="asc">V</span>, part <span class="asc">I</span>, page 39.

certainly connected in some way with the first appearance of white people in northern
British Columbia and with the first efforts of Christian missionaries. Bī′nĭ evidently
= Peni, from ni “mind,” a Carrier Indian, who, immediately after the appearance of
the first Catholic missionaries, claimed remarkable supernatural powers and started
a kind of sporadic cult which spread throughout much of the northern part of British
Columbia. (See Morice, Hist. of the N. Interior of Brit. Col., p. 235.) At Masset
I discovered that certain songs there had been obtained, or were supposed to have
been obtained, from a Jesuit missionary on the Skeena. The Christian influences apparent
in this story evidently emanated from the same source, as <span class="pageNum" id="pb315">[<a href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>Bᴀlê′la’s and Bī′ni’s songs are all said to have been revealed at a place up the Skeena

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Version obtained by Prof. Franz Boas.]
</p>
<p>Ten men intended to catch fish near Q’a′daso near ʟō [New Kloo]. They went there in
their canoe and caught the fish by means of snares which were attached to the points
of poles. One of these men wore a hat showing a design of a cormorant (k·ʼā′lo) belonging
to the Eagle clan. Whenever he caught a fish his hat fell down into the water, so
that he did not catch any thing more. Finally he grew angry and scolded the water.
He took his hat and said: “I strike your vulva with this hat, Djila′qons.” Finally
the people went ashore, where they made a large fire, intending to eat the fish. [The
name of the fish was Tā′ʟat, the charr (or rainbow-trout)]. They roasted them. After
a little while a large frog came up to the fire. They took it and threw it into the
flames, and laughed when they saw it burn. After a short while there was a clap of
thunder, and the frog burst. After a little while the same frog came back. They put
more wood upon the fire, and threw the frog into it; but when it was red-hot it jumped
out of the fire.
</p>
<p>Now they returned to their village. They saw a man walking along the beach, following
them. He shouted: “When your canoe reaches yonder point of land, one of you shall
die. At the next point of land the second one of the number shall die, until you are
all dead. Only the steersman shall reach your village, where he shall tell what has
befallen you, and then he, too, shall die.”
</p>
<p>After a little while they heard a large man coming, who struck his abdomen, and the
sound was like that of a drum. Then they laughed at him. They struck his abdomen with
sticks in order to hear the noise. He said: “I wish to help you,” but they did not
listen to him. He said: “A fire is coming. It is going to burn everything.” After
a while they saw an animal coming, with a beak like that of a mosquito.
</p>
<p>Another day a few men went out hunting seals. They met a seal which looked up at the
sky and said: “This cloud looks as though all the people were going to die. The same
thing happened long ago.” [All these were prophesies of the general destruction of
the tribe.] Then the man returned without killing the seal.
</p>
<p>Now the whole town was burned. The fire came from the water, burning everything. All
the people were killed. Only a young girl who had just reached maturity hid in a cellar
near the doorway where <span class="pageNum" id="pb317">[<a href="#pb317">317</a>]</span>the people used to urinate. She alone was saved. Her name was Yēʟʼukx·īna′ng. Then
Djila′qons came from out of the water. She took her staff, beat time with it, and
sang a mourning song. She found the young girl, who became the mother of the Djʼēguaʟlānas.
</p>
<p class="small">This is one of the most important Haida family stories, Djila′qons being considered
the ancestress, or at all events special patroness, of all those of the Eagle clan,
while from Sounding-property, the sole survivor of the town of Djī′gua, were descended
the following four great groups of Eagles: Those-born-at-Skedans and the Town-of-Djī′gua-people
of Old Kloo, the Witch people of Cumshewa, and the Sealion town people of Kaisun.
Besides these several claim to have branched off from the above, and the Lā′na tcꜝā′adᴀs
claim her as their ancestress because a man of their family took her over to the Tsimshian.
They are not, of course, regularly entitled to the distinction.

<p class="small">A version of this story obtained by myself was printed in the Memoirs of the American
Museum of Natural History, Jesup North Pacific Expedition, V, part I, pages 94–96,
and another was printed by Professor Boas in his <span lang="de">Indianische Sagen von der Nord-Pacifischen Küste Amerikas</span>, Berlin, 1895, pp. 310, 311. My story-teller gave the following as one of the crying
songs used by Djila′qons at this time: Wâ â hâ â g̣adā′g̣a-łîña′-i⁺hēyē, etc., the
whole being accompanied by weeping, sobbing, and the labored breathing that accompanies.
The two words mean “those who were going to have property,” the thought being “Oh!
those that would have had property if I had let them alone!”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Tom Stevens, chief of Those-born-at-House-point]
</p>
<p>The son of the town chief of House-point was half crazy. The children of the town
played at G̣ałna′s,<a class="noteRef" id="n318.1src" href="#n318.1">1</a> and all went home, and he came after them. And in the place where they had been playing
something with four faces was rolling around, [exclaiming]: “Great-crazy-days, Great-crazy-days.”
Then he ran to catch it, but he did did not see whither it went.
</p>
<p>One time he threw stones at it. After he had done this several times he saw whither
it went. Then he chased it. He chased it, chased it a while, and it went into the
ocean before him. And he also jumped right in after it. After he had pursued it along
upon a trail in the ocean for a while, he chased it out in front of “Upset-canoe”<a class="noteRef" id="n318.2src" href="#n318.2">2</a> and it sat waiting for him on the beach. Then he sat near it. It talked to him there.
</p>
<p>Then it took a bag off of its back, laid it near by, took out of it a partly finished
canoe and taught him how they were going to make them. It told him how they would
stretch it and would build a fire inside.
</p>
<p>Then it took cedar bark out of its bag. It told him its name was g̣a-i.<a class="noteRef" id="n318.3src" href="#n318.3">3</a> It told him they would use this for houses. And it told him they would sew together
the canoes with the cedar limbs and fasten the cross seats in place with them.
</p>
<p>After it was through telling him, it struck the man with its elbow. Yū′iyā′⁺. It pushed
him down. It became a bird and walked down from him flapping its wings. It dived and
came up far out. But then he saw a Redhead<a class="noteRef" id="n318.4src" href="#n318.4">4</a> floating on the water out at sea. That it was that was helping the people to settle
at House-point.
</p>
<p>And afterward he came home. And he told his friends. Then they began to make a canoe.
As he told them, they fastened down the seats with cedar limbs. When it was broken,
they sewed it together with them. And, when he explained to them about the cedar bark,
they also took that. They put cross sticks<a class="noteRef" id="n318.5src" href="#n318.5">5</a> in the pieces and made houses. This is how they began to live under cedar barks.
And at that time they also began fishing in the ocean.
</p>
<p>And it also taught him other things in the same way. It told him how they were going
to fasten halibut hooks with roots. And it told him that they should pull off cedar
bark and weave mats out of it. It also told him that they should twist it into ropes
and use it that way in fishing.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>After some time had passed, they had snares set for eagles. And they sat in holes
under these. When any were caught in them they broke their wings, and at evening they
took as many as they knew were theirs.
</p>
<p>One day a man caught one with slender claws. And, when he went for all at evening,
one of his eagles was lost. The Tsimshian bought the feathers. That was why they gathered
them. Then they reported to one another that one had a hawk.<a class="noteRef" id="n319.6src" href="#n319.6">6</a> And he who missed one of his own heard it was his and went to ask for it. Then they
would not give it to him, and some quarrels took place.
</p>
<p>Then they put on their weapons. They put on ta′oga-i,<a class="noteRef" id="n319.7src" href="#n319.7">7</a> gorgets, helmets, war coats, and two thick hides, one over another. [They had] war
spears. The young men had bows. And they came together. After they had fought there
with each other for a while, they stopped and moved apart.<a class="noteRef" id="n319.8src" href="#n319.8">8</a>
</p>
<p>After a long, quiet interval, a person went to Peoples’ town<a class="noteRef" id="n319.9src" href="#n319.9">9</a> to gamble and [saw] another come out from Peoples’ town wearing marten-skin blankets
with the fur turned out. His gambling-stick bag hung from a wooden float. He reported
it to them, and they ran thither. Then he kept crying: “G̣ᴀngūdā′ñ. My seed. My seed.”<a class="noteRef" id="n319.10src" href="#n319.10">10</a>
</p>
<p>From the town one went to sell a copper worth ten slaves called “Upsetter-of-the-town.”
And, when they were on their way back, there was a great smoke at the town, and they
ventured guesses about it. One said that the town was being burned. Another said that
some kind of clam was being put into the fire.
</p>
<p>When they got close in front of the town of Łgīła-a′la,<a class="noteRef" id="n319.11src" href="#n319.11">11</a> they were pushing one [prisoner] down to the beach. His name was Letting-go-of-each-other.
The Inlet people<a class="noteRef" id="n319.12src" href="#n319.12">12</a> had burned the town. The war chief was called Burnt-forest.<a class="noteRef" id="n319.13src" href="#n319.13">13</a>
</p>
<p>And, when they saw them coming, they chased them seaward. And they paddled toward
Cape Ball to escape. Then they got near it and fastened the copper to the paddle.
And, when they held it up high, they tried to catch them all the harder. Then they
upset themselves and swam downward. Chief Points-meeting-in-the-water and chief Going-after-property
were drowned at the bottom. Afterward Burnt-forest dove after the copper and recovered
it neatly.
</p>
<p>Then they (the people who were drowned) went and sat in front of Chief’s<a class="noteRef" id="n319.14src" href="#n319.14">14</a> house. They begged him for a flood. He asked them to come in. They refused. The warriors
started home and camped beyond Raven creek.<a class="noteRef" id="n319.15src" href="#n319.15">15</a> The weather was calm. Toward evening two tidal waves rolled in out of the ocean.
The first one came in and broke. The canoes with their skids even drifted away. The
last one even washed away the trees by their roots. Half of the warriors were lost.
And he (Burnt-forest) escaped along with his copper into the woods and carried it
off on his back.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb320">[<a href="#pb320">320</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then, by washing away the front of Tow hill,<a class="noteRef" id="n320.16src" href="#n320.16">16</a> the waves washed dentalium shells to the surface. The Inlet [people] dug them. They
paddled north<a class="noteRef" id="n320.17src" href="#n320.17">17</a> with them to sell them for slaves. They bought slaves.
</p>
<p>After that, when they quarreled with one of Those-born-at-House-point, he would say
in answer: “Well! Inlet people ceased moving their own bucket handles because my uncles
drowned themselves.” The Inlet people had plenty of slaves.
</p>
<p>And a man of Those-born-at-House-point made figures of the supernatural beings on
his house. The ends of the roof poles had images of human beings on them face up.
This house was washed away five times. Then he named himself Chief-who-renews-his-property.
</p>
<p>[The following short story, obtained by Professor Boas from Charlie Edenshaw, chief
of the Stᴀ′stas at Masset, is added for purposes of comparison and as containing supplementary
material.]
</p>
<p>After the deluge, Naēku′n was the first place to emerge from the waters. People were
holding a council to determine which way to go. While they were still deliberating
a two-faced man came and asked them why they could not make up their minds, and told
them which way to go.
</p>
<p>At that time the Raven traveled all over the earth, and one day he found a cockle
which was being thrown about by the waves. He heard a noise inside the shell. He went
near to see what it was. He hid near by and discovered many children in the cockleshell.
He opened it and found many people. Then he made towns. One of these he called Yaku
lanas, another one Kuna lanas, and he gave all the families of the Haida their names.
On the beach he made a town, Tas lanas; and in the woods he made one which he called
Sʟeng lanas (“rear part of the house”).<a class="noteRef" id="n320.18src" href="#n320.18">18</a>
</p>
<p id="ch3.26.n" class="small">My informant, who is now chief of Those-born-at-House-point, began by saying that
when the flood raised by Raven’s uncle subsided a woman was sitting upon House-point
(i.e., Nekoon or Rose spit). This woman had four teats, each of which was owned by
one of the Raven families of House-point, the Eggs of Skî′tg̣ao Rear-town people,
Point-town people, Those-born-at-House-point. After her people had begun to increase
they pulled grass over themselves, began to twirl one stick upon another to light
fires and, since they had no canoes, floated their fishing lines off from the great
spit. The story-teller probably intended these particulars to be included as part
of his relation. I also have a Masset version of that part of the story which deals
with the war at House-point.

<h2 class="main"><span class="sc">How the Seaward-sqoā′ładas obtained the names of their gambling sticks</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Walter McGregor of the Sealion-town people]
</p>
<p>His father was a chief in Sealion-town.<a class="noteRef" id="n322.1src" href="#n322.1">1</a> His name was Poor-chief’s-son.<a class="noteRef" id="n322.2src" href="#n322.2">2</a> One time his father was going to have a potlatch. Then his father went to invite
the Tsimshian. While he was gone, Gasî′na-ᴀ′ndju<a class="noteRef" id="n322.3src" href="#n322.3">3</a> began to gamble. After he had gambled for some time, he lost all of his father’s
property. Then he put a bladder full of grease into his gambling-stick bag. And he
put it on his back and went away.
</p>
<p>After he had traveled for a while, he went in<a class="noteRef" id="n322.4src" href="#n322.4">4</a> at White-rocks. As he went he ate all kinds of leaves.<a class="noteRef" id="n322.5src" href="#n322.5">5</a> Presently he wanted to defecate, and he defecated at a rotten stump. And after that
he again went about eating leaves. After he had gone along for a while, he passed
over the bones of two human beings upon which moss was growing.
</p>
<p>And, after he had gone on a while longer, he came to where two streams flowed down
from Djū′tcꜝîtga,<a class="noteRef" id="n322.6src" href="#n322.6">6</a> near which lay the fresh bones of two persons. One stream was red. The other was
blue. Djū′tcꜝîtga’s manure made it red, they say, and his medicine made it blue. Those
who drank from the red one died there.
</p>
<p>Then he took the grease out of his bladder, and he greased his insides. Then he put
his head into the blue one. After he had drunk for a while, he lost consciousness.
When he came to himself he was standing in front of a big house with a two-headed
house pole. And they told him to come in. At once he entered.
</p>
<p>The chief<a class="noteRef" id="n322.7src" href="#n322.7">7</a> in the house said to him: “News of you has come, grandson. You gambled away all of
your father’s potlatch property.” Then the chief had a small box brought to him, and
he took a hawk feather out of it. Then he put it into the corner of his (the youth’s)
eye. After he had twisted it around there for a while, he pulled it out and took out
blood<a class="noteRef" id="n322.8src" href="#n322.8">8</a> and moss from it.
</p>
<p>After he had finished both he said to him “Let me see your gambling sticks,” and he
gave them to him. He squeezed them. Then blood<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n322.8asrc" href="#n322.8">8</a> came out. And, after he had touched his lips to his hands, he cut around the middle
of one of them with his finger nail. It was red. And he said to him: “<span class="corr" id="xd32e26890" title="Source: It’s">Its</span> name shall be Coming-out-ten-times.” And, after he had touched his lips to his hands
again, he cut around on another of them near the end. The end of it was red. Then
he said: “Its name shall be Sticking-into-the-clouds.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>As soon as he brought out his gambling sticks to him, he named them. He continued
to name them: “Thing-always-carried-along,” “Always-running-off,” “Bloody-nose,” “Shaking-his-head-as-he-goes-along,”
“Common-one,” “Rattling-bone,” “Elderberry-roots,” and “Russet-backed-thrush” (?).<a class="noteRef" id="n323.9src" href="#n323.9">9</a>
</p>
<p>Large canoes were piled up in the corner of his house. That meant that the Tsimshian
had come during his absence. And two young fellows who looked transparent were in
his house. He said that one should go with him. “This one will go with you. He will
take away your djîl when you gamble first.<a class="noteRef" id="n323.10src" href="#n323.10">10</a> Do not choose the fine cedar bark out of which smoke comes. Take that that has no
smoke. After you have counted seven, take the one out of which smoke comes. Then begin
with ‘Coming-out-ten-times.’ ” After he had got through telling this to him, he said
to him: “Go home.” Lo! he awoke.
</p>
<p>Then he went out at the same place where he had started in. Below the stump from which
he had defecated lay a sea otter. He looked at the sea. The sea otter was drifting
shoreward. Then he went down to it, took it, and dried it. And he went from there
to Sealion-town.
</p>
<p>When he had almost reached it, he came to some dogs fighting with each other for a
gambling-stick bag which lay on the left side of the place where the broad, red trail
came out. The dogs fought for the fat which was in it. And he looked into it. A small
copper was in it. He took it, and he came home.
</p>
<p>And he came to the ten canoes of the Tsimshian who had arrived. He went in to his
mother and ate as usual. He also drank water.
</p>
<p>Next day gambling began. He went out and staked the sea otter. They tried to get ahead
of one another in playing for it. The Tsimshian wanted to gamble with him. Then one
came to gamble with him. The Tsimshian handled the sticks first. And he did not take
the one which smoked. After he had counted seven he took the one which smoked. He
got the djîl.
</p>
<p>Then he took up “Coming-out-ten-times” as they had told him. [They said] “He is losing
as he always does.” Then he handled the sticks. He counted ten. He had “Sticking-into-the-clouds”
and this one [besides his blank] left.<a class="noteRef" id="n323.11src" href="#n323.11">11</a> With them he won. He stopped missing it. He handled the sticks. Then he held the
blank over his shoulder. He took it away.<a class="noteRef" id="n323.12src" href="#n323.12">12</a> They did not see it.
</p>
<p>He won every single thing from the Tsimshian. After he had all of their property he
also won their canoes. By and by a little old man behind the crowd of his opponents,
who had just bathed and had the right side of his face marked with paint, wanted to
gamble with him. And, after they had staked property, the Tsimshian handled the sticks.
Smoke came out of both heaps of cedar bark. Then he selected that which smoked the
most. He got one of those with many marks.<a class="noteRef" id="n323.13src" href="#n323.13">13</a> And he handled them again. He took the one with the <span class="pageNum" id="pb324">[<a href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>smaller smoke. Again he got one of those with many marks. It was a good day for him
(the Tsimshian). That was why he (<span class="corr" id="xd32e26936" title="Source: Gasî′na-ᴀ′ndjū">Gasî′na-ᴀ′ndju</span>) could not see his djîl. He was the only one who beat him.
</p>
<p>Then his father’s potlatch was over. They gave the Tsimshian their canoes. Then he
had the breast of his son tattooed. He had the figure of a cormorant put on him. He
had its neck run through him. He had its wings laid on each side of his shoulders.
He had its beak put on his breast. On his back he had its tail put. He was the only
Raven who had the cormorant for a crest. No one had it that way afterward. The Tsimshian
went home.
</p>
<p>He had his father’s house pole made like Djū′tcꜝîtga’s. At that time he named the
house “Two-headed-house.” The Seaward-Sqoā′ładas own the gambling-stick names.
</p>
<p class="small">All Haida families do not have distinctive family myths as is the case among the Kwakiutl
and Bella Coola. Some, however, have stories telling how they obtained the right to
certain names, crests, etc., and the following is one of that number. It explains
the origin of the names employed by the Seaward-Sqoā′ładas, a Raven family of Skidegate
inlet, for the sticks in their gambling sets, and at the same time how the Sealion-town
people, an Eagle family, obtained the right to a certain style of house pole with
two heads. One of the old Kaisun houses, Na-qā′dji-stîns, “Two-headed-house,” was
named from a pole of this kind which stood in front of it.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Walter McGregor of the Sealion-town people.]
</p>
<p>His name was Sqî′lg̣aᴀlᴀn.<a class="noteRef" id="n325.1src" href="#n325.1">1</a> His wife belonged to the Seaward-sqoā′ładas, and her name was A′łg̣a-sīwa′t. They
were camping at Djiłū′.
</p>
<p>And, when the tide was low, he went seaward. He heard some puppies yelping. He looked
for them. He could not find them. Then he began to eat medicine. After he had eaten
medicine for a while, he went seaward again. Again he heard the puppies yelping.
</p>
<p>After he had gone toward the place where they were yelping the yelping sounded behind
him. After he had done this for a while he found two small pups among some stones
lying in a pool of salt water. Then he pick them up and stood up planks on edge for
them around a hollow between the roots of a tree behind the house. And he had them
live there. He hid them. He named one of them Found and the other Helper. He fed them
secretly.
</p>
<p>When they became larger they went into the water early one morning. They came shoreward
together. They had a tomcod in their mouths. They gave it to him. He said he had gone
out to look for it very early. And he brought it into the house.
</p>
<p>Again they swam seaward. They brought in a red cod in their mouths. When they started
off again they brought back a halibut in their mouths. When they became larger they
brought in a piece bitten out of a whale. All that time he said he had found the things.
When he had a quantity of food he carried the whale to his brothers-in-law<a class="noteRef" id="n325.2src" href="#n325.2">2</a> at Skidegate as a gift.
</p>
<p>They were nearly starved at Skidegate when he came and gave them what he had. The
day after he arrived he went for firewood. When he brought it in the food was all
gone. He wished to eat some salmon eggs put up in bladders which his mother-in-law
owned. She did not give them to him. At that time he kept repeating: “I guess there
will be plenty in the dogs’ house.” Then his mother-in-law said: “I wonder what sort
of dogs have grease all over their house.” His mother-in-law was stingy.
</p>
<p>Next day he again came in from getting wood and said the same thing as before. And
his mother-in-law again said: “I wonder what sort of dogs have grease all over their
house.”
</p>
<p>Next day he started for Djiłū′, and his mother-in-law went with him. After they had
gone along for a while they came to a porpoise floating about, and his mother-in-law
wanted it. He paid no attention <span class="pageNum" id="pb326">[<a href="#pb326">326</a>]</span>to her. After they had gone on for a while longer, they came to a hair seal floating
about. His mother-in-law also wanted that. He paid no attention to her.
</p>
<p>After they had gone on for a while from there, they came to pieces bitten out of a
whale floating about. Those his mother-in-law also wanted, and he said: “Nasty! that
is my dogs’ manure.” And after they had gone on for another space of time, they came
to a jaw good on both sides. Then he cut off two pieces from it and took them in.
</p>
<p>Now he landed at Djiłū′, and he would let his mother-in-law eat nothing but fat food.
When his mother-in-law went down to get sea eggs he spilt whale grease around before
her upon the sea eggs. He also spilt whale grease around in the water. He was killing
his mother-in-law with mental weariness.<a class="noteRef" id="n326.3src" href="#n326.3">3</a>
</p>
<p>Then the dogs brought in two whales apiece. He (each) had one laid between his ears
and one laid near his tail.
</p>
<p>His wife became two-faced (i.e., treacherous) to him. She discovered that the dogs
always went out at daybreak. Then she allowed urine and blue hellebore to rot together.
</p>
<p>One day, when the dogs were coming in together, she put hot stones into this mixture.
And, when it was boiling, she poured it into the ocean. At once the wind raised big
waves. There was no place where the dogs could come ashore. The dogs carried some
islands out to sea in trying to scramble up them. One is called Sea-eggs, the other
G̣agu′n.
</p>
<p>Then they swam southward. He watched them from the shore. They tried to climb ashore
on the south side of the entrance of Skidegate channel.<a class="noteRef" id="n326.4src" href="#n326.4">4</a> But they only made marks with their claws on the rocks instead. They could not do
it. Then they swam away. On that account they call this place “Where-dogs-tried-to-crawl-up-and-slid-back.”
Then they swam together to the channel.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n326.4asrc" href="#n326.4">4</a> They lie in front of Da′x̣ua.<a class="noteRef" id="n326.5src" href="#n326.5">5</a> They call them “The Dogs.”<a class="noteRef" id="n326.6src" href="#n326.6">6</a>
</p>
<p>He had many whales. He filled up “Whale-creek.” He bent boxes for them, and he put
the whale grease into them. By selling these he became a chief.<a class="noteRef" id="n326.7src" href="#n326.7">7</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Walter McGregor, of the Sealion-town people]
</p>
<p>Some persons went out hunting from Songs-of-victory town.<a class="noteRef" id="n327.1src" href="#n327.1">1</a> And one of them put on the skin of a hair seal and lay on a reef. Then some went
hunting from Food-steamer’s<a class="noteRef" id="n327.2src" href="#n327.2">2</a> town. One of them speared the hair seal lying on the reef with his bone spear. But
a human being screamed.
</p>
<p>They used to put on the skin of a hair seal, lie on a reef and make the cry of a hair
seal, and, when a hair seal came up, one sitting behind him speared it. They speared
him (the man) while he was doing that way. Then they went off in terror.
</p>
<p>And then they began fighting with one another. The Songs-of-victory people went out
first, and they killed Food-steamer’s wife with arrows. Then they fought continually
with one another. At that time they killed each other off.
</p>
<p>Falling-tide was a brave man among the people of Songs-of-victory town. One time,
when he got back from fighting, he threw his kelp fish line into the fire. Then he
occupied a fort. At that time he had nothing to eat. He spoiled himself.<a class="noteRef" id="n327.3src" href="#n327.3">3</a> After that they also killed him, and only the town of Kaisun was left.
</p>
<p>One day they stretched out a black-cod fishing line upon the beach in front of Kaisun
with the intention of seeing how far down the house of The-one-in-the-sea was. But,
when they went out fishing, they never came back. Then that town was also gone.<a class="noteRef" id="n327.4src" href="#n327.4">4</a>
</p>
<p>They used to go fishing at night, because they said that the black cod came to the
surface of the sea during the night.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Before this, when the town people were still there, a child refused to touch some
black cod. And, after he had cried for a while, something moving burning coals about
called him through the doorway;<a class="noteRef" id="n327.5src" href="#n327.5">5</a> “Come here, my child; grandmother has some roots mixed with grease which she put
away for you.”
</p>
<p>Then his parents told him to go out, and he went thither. It stretched its arm in
to him into the house, and the child said: “Horrors,<a class="noteRef" id="n327.6src" href="#n327.6">6</a> something with large, cold hands grasped me.” Then it said: “Grandfather has just
come in from fishing. I have been washing gills. That is why he says my hands are
cold.”
</p>
<p>Then his parents again told him to go out, and he went out to it. It threw him into
a basket made of twisted boughs. Then the child cried, and they went out to look at
him. He was crying within the earth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb328">[<a href="#pb328">328</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then they began to dig. They dug after the sound of his crying in the earth. By and
by they dug out the tail of the marten he wore as a blanket. There are now ditches
in that place.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The chief’s children in the town of Kaisun went on a picnic. They had a picnic behind
Narrow-cave.<a class="noteRef" id="n328.7src" href="#n328.7">7</a> Then all went out of the cave from the town chief’s daughter. Some of them went to
drink water. Part of them went after food. Some of them also went to get fallen limbs
[for firewood].
</p>
<p>Then she thought “I wish these rocks would fall upon me,” and toward her they fell.
Then she heard them talking and weeping outside. And, after she had also cried for
a while, she started a fire. Then she felt sleepy and slept. She awoke. A man lay
back to the fire on the opposite side. That was Narrow-cave, they say.
</p>
<p>Then he looked at her, and he asked her: “Say! noble woman,<a class="noteRef" id="n328.8src" href="#n328.8">8</a> what sort of things have they put into your ears?” And the child said to him: “They
drove sharp knots into them and put mountain sheep wool into them.” Then he took sharp
knots out of a little box he used as a pillow. Now Narrow-cave laid his head on some
planks for her, and she pushed them into his ears. “Wa wa wa wa wa, it hurts too much.”
Then she at once stopped. And, when he asked her to do it again, she again had him
put his head on the plank. It hurt him, but still she drove it into his ear. His buttocks
moved a while, and then he was dead.
</p>
<p>Then she again cried for a while. She heard the noise of some teeth at work and presently
saw light through a small hole. Then she put some grease around it, and the next day
it got larger. Every morning the hole was larger, until she came out. It was Mouse
who nibbled through the rock.
</p>
<p>Then she was ashamed to come out, and, when it was evening, she came and stood in
front of her father’s house. And one of her father’s slaves said she was standing
outside. They told him he lied. They whipped him for it.
</p>
<p>Then her father’s nephew went out to look for her. She was really standing there.
And her father brought out moose hides for her. She came in upon them. They laid down
moose hides for her in the rear of the house. She came in and sat there.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Then her father called in the people. She recounted in the house the things that had
happened. When she had finished she became as one who falls asleep. They guessed that
she had gone into his (Narrow-cave’s) house to live.
</p>
<p>One moonlight night they (the children) went to Tcꜝixodᴀ′ñqꜝēt<a class="noteRef" id="n328.9src" href="#n328.9">9</a> to play. And two persons came to a boy who was walking far behind, took him off with
them, and led him to a fine house.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb329">[<a href="#pb329">329</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then they asked each other: “What shall we give him to eat?” “Give him the fat of
bullheads’ heads.” And they gave him food. In the night he awoke. He was lying upon
some large roots. And in the morning he heard them say: “There are fine [weather]
clouds.” Then they went fishing, and, when it was evening, they built a large fire.
He saw them put their tails into the fire, and it was quenched. And next day, after
they had gone out fishing, he ran away.
</p>
<p>Then they came after him. And he climbed up into a tree standing by a pond in the
open ground. They hunted for him. Then he moved on the tree, and they jumped into
the pond after his shadow.
</p>
<p>Then they saw him sitting up there, and they called to him to come down. “Probably,<a class="noteRef" id="n329.10src" href="#n329.10">10</a> drop down upon my knees.” And they could not get him. They left him.
</p>
<p>Then he started off. He came in to his parents. He came in after having been lost,
and his mother gave him a ground-hog blanket to wear.
</p>
<p>Then he went out to play with the others one day, and something said to him from among
the woods: “Probably is proud of his ground-hog blanket. He does not care for me as
he moves about.” He did not act differently on account of this.<a class="noteRef" id="n329.11src" href="#n329.11">11</a> Those who took him away were the Land-otter people.
</p>
<p class="small">The Pitch-people (Qꜝās lā′nas) occupied much of the northwestern coast of Moresby
island between Tas-oo harbor and Kaisun, but, when the Sealion-town people moved to
the west coast, they seem to have driven the Pitch-people out of their northern towns.
They were always looked upon as an uncultivated branch of Haida, and are said not
to have possessed any crests. Later they intermarried with the Cumshewa people. Some
of the Cumshewa people claim descent from them, but none of the true Pitch-people
are in existence. The relationship of their culture to that of the other Haida would
be an interesting problem for archeologists. The following stories regarding these
people were obtained from a man of the Sealion-town people who supplanted them.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Walter McGregor of the Sealion-town people]
</p>
<p>The town children were knocking a woody excrescence<a class="noteRef" id="n330.1src" href="#n330.1">1</a> back and forth. After they had played for a while they began saying “Haskwä′.”<a class="noteRef" id="n330.2src" href="#n330.2">2</a> The niece of the town chief was menstruant for the first time. She sat behind the
screens.<a class="noteRef" id="n330.3src" href="#n330.3">3</a>
</p>
<p>After they had played for a while a red feather floated along in the air above them.
By and by a child seized the feather. His hand stuck to it. Something pulled him up.
And one seized him by the feet. When he was also pulled up another grasped his feet
in turn. After this had gone on for a while all the people in the town were pulled
up.
</p>
<p>Then the one who was menstruant did not hear them talking in the house. She was surprised,
and looked toward the door. There was no one in the house. Then she went outside.
There were no people about the town. Then she went into the houses. She saw that they
were all empty.
</p>
<p>Then she began to walk about weeping. She put her belt on. Then she blew her nose
and wiped it on her shoulder. And she put shavings her brothers had been playing with
inside of her blanket. Feathers and wild crab apple wood, pieces of cedar bark,<a class="noteRef" id="n330.4src" href="#n330.4">4</a> and mud from her brothers’ footprints she put into her blanket.
</p>
<p>By and by, without having been married, she became pregnant. Soon she gave birth.
Again she became pregnant. Again she bore a boy. After this had gone on for some time,
the youngest came out with medicine in his mouth. He had a blue hole in his cheek.
With a girl they were ten.
</p>
<p>And she started to rear them. She brought home all kinds of food that was in the town.
She gave this to her children to eat. Very soon they grew up. They began playing about
the house.
</p>
<p>By and by one of them asked their mother: “Say! mother, what town lies here empty?”
And his mother said to him: “Why! my child, your uncles’ town lies here empty.” Then
she began telling the story. <span class="corr" id="xd32e27123" title="Not in source">“</span>The children of this town used to go out playing skîtqꜝ′ā′-ig̣adañ. Then a red feather
floated around above them. I sat behind the planks. There I discovered that the town
lay empty, and I was the only one left. There I bore you.” Like this she spoke to
them.
</p>
<p>Then they asked their mother what was called “skîtqꜝā′-ig̣adᴀñ.” Then she said to
them: “They smoothed the surface of a woody <span class="corr" id="xd32e27127" title="Source: excresence">excrescence</span>, and they played with it here.”
</p>
<p>Then they went to get one. They worked it, and, after they had <span class="pageNum" id="pb331">[<a href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>finished it, they played about on the floor planks of the house with it. While they
were still playing daylight came. And next day they also played outside. The feather
again floated about above them. Their mother told them not to take hold of the feather.
</p>
<p>After they had played for a while the eldest, who was heedless, seized the feather.
His hand stuck to it. When he was pulled up he turned into mucus. After it had been
stretched out five times the end was pulled up. Another one seized it. He became a
shaving. After he had been stretched out five times he, too, was pulled away.
</p>
<p>Another one grasped it. He became a feather. After something had pulled him up five
times he also left the ground. Another one seized it. He became a strip of cedar bark.
After something had pulled him up five times he also left the ground. And again one
seized it. He became mud. After he had been stretched out five times he left the ground.
And another seized it. The same thing happened to him; and after this had gone on
for a while they were nearly all gone.
</p>
<p>Then again one seized it. He became a wild crab-apple tree. He was strong. And, while
he was being stretched up, his sister went around him. She sharpened her hands. “Make
yourself strong; [be] a man,” she said to her brother. When he had but one root left
his sister climbed quickly up upon him. After she had reached the feather, and had
cut at it for a while, she cut it down. A string of them fell down.
</p>
<p>He who had medicine in his mouth stood over his elder brothers. Upon his elder brothers
he spit medicine. Then they got up. And the bones of those in the town who had been
first pulled up lay around in a heap. He also spit medicine upon them. They also got
up, and the town became inhabited.
</p>
<p>They played with the feather. They went around the town with it. By and by it began
to snow. Then they rubbed the feather on the fronts of the houses of the town, and
the snow was gone.<a class="noteRef" id="n331.5src" href="#n331.5">5</a> After they had done so for a while the snow surmounted the house.
</p>
<p>After some time a blue jay dropped a ripe elderberry through the smoke hole. By and
by they went out through the smoke hole. They went to see Bill-of-heaven.<a class="noteRef" id="n331.6src" href="#n331.6">6</a>
</p>
<p>After they had gone along for a while, they came to a djo′lgi<a class="noteRef" id="n331.7src" href="#n331.7">7</a> walking around. Then he who was full of mischief tore the animal in pieces and threw
them about. After they had gone on some distance from there, they came to a woman
living in a big house. Her labret was large. When she began to give them something
to eat the woman asked them: “Was my child playing over there when you passed?” And
one said to her: “No, only a djo′lgi played there. We tore it in pieces, and we threw
it around.” “Alas! my child,” said the woman. “Door, shut yourself.” Xō-ō, it sounded.
</p>
<p>Then he who knew the medicine became a cinder, and he let himself go through the smoke
hole. When he got outside, “Smoke hole, shut <span class="pageNum" id="pb332">[<a href="#pb332">332</a>]</span>yourself” [she said]. That also sounded Xō-ō. Then he ran quickly to the place where
they had torn up the djo′lgi and, gathering up the pieces, put them together and spit
medicine upon them. The djo′lgi shook itself, and started for the house with him.
</p>
<p>The djo′lgi tapped upon the door. “Grandmother, here I am.” And when she had said
“Door, unlock yourself; smoke hole, open yourself,” so it happened. Then she began
giving them food. She gave them all kinds of good food to eat. That was Cliff’s house,
they say. She is the djo′lgi’s grandmother.
</p>
<p>And they stayed all night in her house, and next day she again gave them something
to eat. Then they started off. After they had traveled for a while, they came to where
another woman lived. And, after she had given them food, they stayed in her house
all night as well.
</p>
<p>And, after he who was full of mischief saw that the woman was asleep, he went to her
daughter who lay behind the screen. And he put her belt around himself. After he had
lain for a while with her her mother saw him. Then she took out the man’s heart and
swallowed it.<a class="noteRef" id="n332.8src" href="#n332.8">8</a> Then he put her belt around her, went from her, and lay down.
</p>
<p>Next morning, after she had given them something to eat there, she called her daughter.
She paid no attention to her, and she went to her. She lay dead. Then she began to
weep. She composed a crying song, “My daughter I mistook.” Then they left her.
</p>
<p>After they had gone on for a while they came to where a big thing stood. When they
pushed it down it fell upon two of them. Seven escaped and went off.
</p>
<p>After they had gone on for a long space of time they came to a small dog lying in
the trail. One jumped over it. Right above it it seized him with its teeth. Another
jumped over it. He was treated in the same way. It killed three and four escaped.
</p>
<p>After they had gone on for a while longer they came to the edge of the sky. It shut
down many times. Then they ran under. Two of them were cut in two and two escaped.
They, however, saw Bill-of-heaven.
</p>
<p class="small">Gunwa being one of the Nass towns, this story would appear to be an importation. It
is paralleled, however, by a Masset myth, the scene of which is laid in a Haida town.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Tom Stevens, chief of Those-born-at-House-point.]
</p>
<p>A certain person was a good hunter with dogs. He also knew other kinds of hunting,
but still he could not get anything. They were starving at the town. And one time,
when he went to hunt, he landed below a mountain. And when he started up some wolves
ran away from him out of a cave near the water. In the place they had left a small
wolf rose up. Then he tried to catch it, and the wolf tried to fight him. Then he
said to it “I adopt you,” and it stopped fighting.
</p>
<p>Then he put it into a bag he had and went home with it, and he hid it in a dry place
near the town. After that he dreamed that it talked to him. It said to him: “Go with
me. Put me off under a great mountain where there are grizzly bears and sit below.
Then I will climb up from you toward the mountain and, when a big grizzly bear rolls
down, cut it up. And, when another one comes down, split it open, but do not touch
it.”
</p>
<p>At once he took it away and put it off under a mountain. Then he went up, and, while
he sat beneath, a big grizzly bear came rolling down. While he was cutting it up another
came rolling down, and he split it open.
</p>
<p>Immediately afterward the small, wet wolf came down. It yelped for joy. It shook itself
and went inside the one that was split open. At once it made a noise chewing it. It
ate it, even to the bones. Although it was so big it consumed it all. Only its skin
lay there.
</p>
<p>Then he put the parts into the canoe and brought them to the town. And they bought
them of him. When they were gone he took it (the wolf) off again. They kept buying
from him.
</p>
<p>When his property was fully sufficient his brother-in-law borrowed it. Then he gave
him directions. “Cut up the one that rolls down first, but the last one that rolls
down only cut open.” Then he gave it to him in the sack in which he kept it.
</p>
<p>Then he started with it and put it off beneath the mountain. Soon after it had gone
up a grizzly bear rolled down, and he cut it up. Afterward another one rolled down,
and he cut that up also. Then the wolf came down. After it had walked about for a
while it began to howl. Then it started away, so that he was unable to catch it. It
went along on a light fall of snow.
</p>
<p>And, when he got home and he (the owner) asked for it, he told him it got away. He
handed him only the empty bag.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb334">[<a href="#pb334">334</a>]</span></p>
<p>At once he bought hide trousers. He also bought moccasins. Immediately he started
off. He put the hides into a sack. Then he landed where he used to put it (the wolf)
off and followed its tracks. He followed its footprints upon the snow lying on the
ground.
</p>
<p>Now, as he went, went, went, he spent many nights. He wore out his moccasins and threw
them away. All the while he followed his son’s footprints upon the snow. He went and
went, and, when his moccasins and trousers were almost used up, he heard many people
talking and came to the end of a town.
</p>
<p>Then he hid himself near the creek, and, when one came after water, he smelt him.
Then he saw him and shouted to him: “So-and-so’s father has come after him.” At once
they ran to get him. His son came in the lead. They were like human beings. Then he
called to his father. He led him into the house in the middle. The son of the chief
among the wolf people had helped him. The house had a house pole.
</p>
<p>Then they gave him food. They steamed fresh salmon for him, and, when they set it
before him, his son told him he better eat. Then he ate. And, after they had fed him
for a while, they brought the hind quarter of a grizzly bear, already cooked, out
of a corner. Then they cut off slices from it and gave them to him to eat.
</p>
<p>He kept picking them up, but still they remained there. They set the whole of it before
him with the slices on top. He did not consume it. It is called: “That-which-is-not-consumed.”
</p>
<p>After he had been there for a while they steamed in the ground deer bones with lichens<a class="noteRef" id="n334.1src" href="#n334.1">1</a> on them. And next day they began to give them to him to eat. Then he did not pick
them up, but he said to his father: “Eat them, father.” He was afraid to eat them
because they were bones. Then he picked one up. But, when he touched it to his lips,
it was soft.
</p>
<p>Every morning they went after salmon. They put on their skins. Then they came home
and brought three or four salmon on the backs of each. They shook themselves, took
off their skins, and hung them up.
</p>
<p>Presently he told his son that he wanted to go away. Then they brought out a sack
and put grizzly-bear fat into it. When the bottom of it was covered they put in mountain-goat
fat. There was a layer of that also. After that they put in deer fat, as well as moose
fat. They put in meat of all the mainland animals.
</p>
<p>After it was filled, and they had laced it up they gave him a cane. It was so large
he did not think he could carry it. And, when he started to put it on his back, his
son said to him: “Push yourself up from the ground with your cane.” Then he did as
directed. He got up easily.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb335">[<a href="#pb335">335</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he gave other directions to his father. “You will travel four nights. When you
camp for the night stick the cane into the ground and in the morning go in the direction
toward which it points. Stick the cane into the ground where you come out. After you
have taken those things out of the sack, take that over also and lay it near the cane.
Those things are only lent you.”
</p>
<p>At once he set out. And, when evening came, he stuck the cane into the ground. But
the cane pointed in the direction from which he had come, and he went toward it. And,
when evening again came, he stuck the cane in, and in the morning the cane was again
pointing backward; and again he followed it.
</p>
<p>After he had camped four nights he came out. And he stuck in the cane at the edge
of the woods. And, while they were again in a starving condition, he came home. They
were unable to bring out his sack. And, when a crowd took hold of it, they got it
off [the canoe], and, after they had taken the best parts of all kinds of animals
out of it, he took the sack back to the cane and laid it near by.
</p>
<p>Then they also began to buy that. With what he got in exchange he became a chief.<a class="noteRef" id="n335.2src" href="#n335.2">2</a> With what he got in exchange he also potlatched. After two nights had passed he went
to see the place where he had left the sack. He saw that they had taken it away.
</p>
<p class="small">Since wolves are not found upon the Queen Charlotte islands, this is necessarily a
mainland story, probably Tsimshian.

<p class="first center">[Told by Jackson, late chief of Skidegate.]
</p>
<p>A certain woman of the upper class, whose father was a chief, was squeamish about
stepping on the dung of grizzly bears. They went with her to pick berries, and then
she started back. At that time her basket strap broke. Now her basket upset. It upset
four times.
</p>
<p>In the evening, when her basket upset for the last time, two good-looking fellows
came to her and asked her to go with them. The two persons begged her to go, and they
said to her: “A little way inland are berries.”
</p>
<p>Then she went back with them. And she said: “Where are they?” They said to the woman:
“A little farther inland.” Now it was evening. And they led her into a big town. Now
they led her into a big house in the middle of the town which had a painting on the
front. A woman who was half rock sat in the corner of the house.
</p>
<p>When they gave her something to eat [this woman said]: “When you eat it, eat only
the shadow.<a class="noteRef" id="n336.1src" href="#n336.1">1</a> Only eat the cranberries they give you to eat. Drink nothing but water. Do not eat
the black, round things they give you to eat. I have been eating them. That is why
I am here. I am half rock. When you go to defecate dig deeply into the ground. Cover
it over.”
</p>
<p>Now she went to defecate as directed. And, when she went to defecate, she laid copper
bracelets on top and copper wire. She finished. Now, after she was gone, a man went
and looked at the place. He saw copper wire and bracelets. Then the man shouted. A
crowd of people looked at it. Truly that was why she did not want to step on dung.
Now she became used to [her surroundings].
</p>
<p>Now all in the town went out to fish for salmon. Afterward the woman went after wood.
Those who went after salmon came back making a noise. Then the woman put wood on the
fire. Those who had gone after salmon came in. Now those who went after salmon shook
themselves. The fire was quenched. Next day they again went after salmon. Then the
half-rock woman said to her: “Take knots.” The woman did so. Now they came back again
with noise. She put knots on the fire. They came in. Again they began shaking themselves.
Then the fire was not quenched. Now her husband’s mind was good toward her.
</p>
<p>Then the woman began to dislike the place. Now they went out again to get salmon.
Then she told the woman who was half rock that she wanted to go away. And she thought
that that was good.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then she gave her a comb. She also gave her some hairs. She also gave her some hair
oil. She also gave her a whetstone. While they were out after salmon she started off.
</p>
<p>Now she heard them pursuing her. They came near her. Then she stuck the comb into
the ground. And she looked back. She saw great masses of fallen trees. Now those behind
her had trouble in getting through. While they were getting through with difficulty
she got a long distance away.
</p>
<p>Again they got near her. She also laid the hair on the ground. Again she looked back.
There was a great amount of brush there. Now they again had trouble behind that. Again
she got a long distance away from them.
</p>
<p>Now the pursuers again came near her. She also poured out the hair oil. And she looked
back. There was a large lake there. They had to skirt its edges. Again the woman ran
hard.
</p>
<p>Now they came near her again. She stuck the whetstone [into the ground]. And the woman
looked back. There was a great cliff there. They could not climb over it. And she
came out of the woods near the sea.
</p>
<p>There one sat in a canoe seaward from her. The woman wanted to get in with him. The
chief wore a large hat. Upon the hat birds flew around in a flock. His name was Sag̣adila′ʻo.
“Let me get in with you. My father will give you ten coppers,” said the woman, trying
to persuade the chief.
</p>
<p>Now the chief struck the edge of his canoe with his club. It came in front of the
woman. The woman got in. He struck the edges of his canoe. Now it floated out at sea
again.
</p>
<p>Then the grizzly bears came out in a crowd. Close to them the wolves also came out
in a crowd. He struck the edges of his canoe. The canoe bit off the heads of the grizzly
bears. It also bit off the heads of the wolves. He destroyed them all.
</p>
<p>Now he let the woman look into his hair. She picked frogs out of his hair. She was
afraid to kill them with her teeth. So she bit upon her finger-nails.<a class="noteRef" id="n337.2src" href="#n337.2">2</a>
</p>
<p>Now he went home with his canoe full of hair seal. He came to his wife, who was in
front of the house. And his wife came to meet him. His wife was glad that he had married
another wife. The woman’s name (i.e., his first wife’s name) was Ła′g̣ał-djat. Now
he brought her to the house.
</p>
<p>He went to hunt again next day, and he gave the following directions to his [new]
wife: “When she eats do not steal a look at her. One always makes her choke by doing
so.” But still she stole a look at her when she ate. And she saw her swallow a whole
hair seal. She saw her spit out the bones toward the door. Then she caused her to
<span class="pageNum" id="pb338">[<a href="#pb338">338</a>]</span>choke by looking at her. For that she killed the woman. Ła′g̣ał-djat did it.
</p>
<p>While her corpse was still lying in the house, Sag̣adila′ʻo came home. Sag̣adila′ʻo
saw his wife’s dead body. Now Sag̣adila′ʻo also killed his older wife. He cut her
in two. Then he put a whetstone between the two parts. They ground themselves into
nothing. Then he awoke the woman. He married her again.
</p>
<p>Now she had a child by him. It was a boy. He kept putting his feet on his (the boy’s)
feet. By pulling he made him grow up. Now he came to maturity. He made him a small
canoe like his own, and he also made a club for him like his own. When he played with
it in the salt-water ponds it picked up small bull-heads with its teeth.
</p>
<p>Then the woman came to dislike the place. And she went to her own place with her boy.
So he came to his own country. And her son married his uncle’s daughter. Then he began
to hunt. The name of the town was Qꜝadō′.<a class="noteRef" id="n338.3src" href="#n338.3">3</a>
</p>
<p>Now, after he had been hunting for some time, a white sea otter came swimming about
in front of the town. And he launched his canoe. He shot it in the tip of the tail.
Then his wife skinned it, and he told her not to let any blood get on it. So she did
not leave any blood on it.
</p>
<p>Now his wife asked for it. He gave it to his wife. The woman washed it in the sea
water. She put it into the sea. Then it slipped off seaward from her. She took a step
after it. It again slipped down from her. She took another step after it.
</p>
<p>Now she got stuck between the two dorsal <span class="corr" id="xd32e27268" title="Source: fine">fins</span> of a killer whale. It swam away with her. Then her husband launched his canoe. He
went after the killer whale. He paddled hard after it. Now he went far off into the
Nass after it. Then his wife disappeared under the water in front of Killer-whale-always-blowing.<a class="noteRef" id="n338.4src" href="#n338.4">4</a>
</p>
<p>Then he went back. And he came to Qꜝadō′. He kept blue hellebore until it had rotted.
He also saved urine. And he also saved the blood of those menstruating for the first
time. And he saved the blood of [any] menstruant women. He put them into a box.
</p>
<p>Then he started off. He [came to the place] where his wife had passed in. Then he
took twisted cedar limbs, a gimlet, and a whetstone. Where his wife had passed in
he came to a kelp with two heads. He went into the water there upon the kelp. Marten
remained upon the water behind him.
</p>
<p>Now he came upon a broad trail. He started along. He came to Lᴀ′mas.<a class="noteRef" id="n338.5src" href="#n338.5">5</a> Then he came to some women digging wild-clover roots. The women said: “I smell Nanasî′mgît.<span class="corr" id="xd32e27281" title="Not in source">”</span> One of the women said so. Then the other one said: “I also smell him.” Now he went
to one of them and opened her eyes. “My eyes are opened. My eyes are <span class="pageNum" id="pb339">[<a href="#pb339">339</a>]</span>opened.” She said that because she felt happy. Then he opened the eyes of the other.
Then, for the first time, he learned his name.
</p>
<p>Now the women asked him what he came for. “I am looking for my wife whom they carried
away from me.” “They passed right by here with your wife. Isnē′g̣ał’s<a class="noteRef" id="n339.6src" href="#n339.6">6</a> son married your wife. The one who married her is named <span class="corr" id="xd32e27290" title="Source: “">‘</span>Gîtgidᴀ′mtcꜝēx.<span class="corr" id="xd32e27293" title="Not in source">’</span> When you come to the town be on the watch. A supernatural heron lives at the end
of the town. He is always watching. He is always repairing a canoe.”
</p>
<p>Then he started. He came to the end of the town. Now the heron discovered him. And
the heron cried out. So he put the twisted cedar limbs, the gimlet, and the whetstone
into his hands. And he put him into his armpit.
</p>
<p>Now the town people came to see what terrible thing had happened. They asked him:
“Old man, why do you say that?” “My sight deceived me. That is why I shouted.” And
they went away from him.
</p>
<p>Then he let him out from his armpit. [He said]: “The one who married your wife lives
in the middle house in the town, and to-morrow two slaves are going for dead hemlocks
standing behind the house. One of the slaves is named Raven. One is named Crow. They
are going to steam the fin to put it on your wife.”
</p>
<p>In the evening he started from him to the town. He looked into the house where his
wife was, in which there were retaining timbers.<a class="noteRef" id="n339.7src" href="#n339.7">7</a> And he saw his wife sitting near her husband. He returned to the old man. And he
spent the night in his house.
</p>
<p>Next day he went behind the town. He came to where the dead hemlocks stood. He sat
down there. Now two slaves came there. Then he went inside of the dead hemlock. Then
they started to chop down the firewood. And he bit off the end of the stone wedge.
They began to cry. One of the slaves said: “My master will talk to me as he usually
does.”
</p>
<p>Now Gunanasî′mgît came out of the firewood. He took the end of the stone wedge out
of his mouth. It became as it had been before. Then he cut down their firewood for
them. He chopped it up for them.
</p>
<p>Then they said to him: “When evening comes they are going to steam your wife’s fin
in the ground. We are going out after water. Now, when evening approaches, stand in
front of the house. After we have gone back and forth with water for a while, we will
let you in. After we have brought water a while we will let ourselves fall with the
water into the bottom of the house excavation. While we turn the water into steam
in the fire, pick up your wife.”
</p>
<p>As soon as evening came he stood in front of the house. At once they let him in. They
went for water. Now the stones became red <span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span>hot. Then they had her fins ready. They had a stone box in readiness on the side toward
the door.
</p>
<p>Now they went after water again, and the last to come in fell down with the water.
A big stream ran into the fire. Then a great steam arose. And he ran over for his
wife. He took her up in his arms. Then he ran back with her.
</p>
<p>[The house pole had three heads. Their voices sounded an alarm. They say they were
always watching.]<a class="noteRef" id="n340.8src" href="#n340.8">8</a>
</p>
<p>Then they found out that she was gone, and they went after her, all the people in
the town. Fast-rainbow-trout pursued him above. Marten pursued him below.<a class="noteRef" id="n340.9src" href="#n340.9">9</a> The two slaves ran in advance. Now they almost caught him, when one slave let himself
fall. He let his belly swell up. Then Mouse<a class="noteRef" id="n340.10src" href="#n340.10">10</a> gnawed through his belly.
</p>
<p>Again they pursued him. When they had nearly caught him again the other slave let
himself fall. Then Weasel<a class="noteRef" id="n340.11src" href="#n340.11">11</a> burst his belly with his teeth.
</p>
<p>Now he came to the place where he had gone down. He entered his canoe. The one left
to take care of the canoe had become an old man. Now he fled. And the killer whales
came in a crowd to his stern. They pursued him. Then they almost upset him. And then
he spilled out the blue hellebore. They sank down from him. Now they again came near
him, and he again spilled some out. Now he came with her to Qꜝadō′.
</p>
<p>Then he came to the house with his wife. And he kept his wife in the bottom of a box.
There were five boxes fitting one inside the other. Day broke. Now he watched his
wife closely. One day, when he looked for his wife, she was gone from the box. There
was a hole in the bottom of the box.
</p>
<p class="small">This is part of the famous Tsimshian story of Gunaqanē′semgyet or Tsag·atilâ′o (see
Boas in <span lang="de">Indianische Sagen von der Nord-Pacifischen Küste Amerikas</span>, pp. 294–300). The same episodes occur in one or two of my Masset stories, and in
the story of <a href="#ch3.8">He-who-got-supernatural-power-from-his-little-finger</a> of the present series, and it is noteworthy that in all Haida versions the adventure
with the killer whale occupies a disproportionately large space. That is also the
section which is always taken for artistic representation.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Jimmy Sterling of the Stᴀ′stas]
</p>
<p>The people of these towns used to visit back and forth. They also gambled together.
From one of these several brothers went to hunt beaver at the beaver lakes where they
were in the habit of getting them. They counted the days.<a class="noteRef" id="n341.1src" href="#n341.1">1</a>
</p>
<p>When they came there and began to destroy the dam this was carried over by the current,
and they floated down in it. They barely saved themselves far below. Now they knew
that some regulation had been broken. But still they continued to live where they
were. And there, too, they did not kill a single thing. Then they went away. Now they
were certain that the wife of one of them was indeed going with some one else.<a class="noteRef" id="n341.2src" href="#n341.2">2</a>
</p>
<p>They camped at night near the town, and just before daylight the eldest went to the
town. He went to his wife. Some one lay with his wife, and he cut off his head. Then
he awoke his wife, and he put the head above the door. At once he went out.
</p>
<p>At once she began to dig a hole for the body, which was left in her bed. Then her
child was crying. At that time they asked her why it cried. And she said it cried
because it had defecated in bed, and she was wiping it. Right there she buried [the
body].
</p>
<p>When day came she lay as she used to. Then her husband came in with his younger brother.
He acted as if he knew nothing about having killed anyone. It was the son of the town
chief on the other side.
</p>
<p>When day came the chief’s son was missing. They visited each other across the ice
upon the river. They hunted about the town in which he was missing. And they also
hunted for him where he had been killed.
</p>
<p>Then they let a slave look for him secretly. They sent him after fire. And he took
his live coals and went away. When he went out blood dropped upon his feet. And he
did not look for the cause. When he came to the middle of the river he let himself
fall with his live coals. Then he returned. He reentered the house where he had got
the live coals. Again he pushed charcoal into the fire on the side toward the door.
And when he went out he looked. He saw the head stuck up on the side toward the door.
When he got back he told them he had seen his head.
</p>
<p>At once they ran thither. Then they began to fight. And, after the fight had gone
on for a while, all the people of the town where the <span class="pageNum" id="pb342">[<a href="#pb342">342</a>]</span>person had been unfaithful to her husband were destroyed. They also burned the town.
</p>
<p>One woman, who was behind the screens when the town burned, escaped to the woods with
her mother. Then the town was entirely burned. Only the woman and her mother were
saved.
</p>
<p>At once they traveled far inland aimlessly. While they were traveling about aimlessly
they came to a high mountain, and she called aimlessly concerning her child. “Who
will marry my daughter?” she shouted loud and long. By and by Grouse<a class="noteRef" id="n342.3src" href="#n342.3">3</a> came flying to her. “Why not I?” he said to her. “What can you do?” Then he said:
“When summer comes, and I drum on the tops of the trees, they can hear my voice everywhere.”
Then she told him he was not good, and he flew away from her.
</p>
<p>By and by she spoke as she had spoken before: “Who will marry my child?” Then Sparrow<a class="noteRef" id="n342.4src" href="#n342.4">4</a> flew to her. And she asked him: “What can you do?” And he answered her: “I will make
summer and winter succeed each other by my singing, and they will hear my voice everywhere.”
Then she said to him: “You are not good.” And he flew from her.
</p>
<p>When she called for her again, Kꜝū′djix̣u<a class="noteRef" id="n342.5src" href="#n342.5">5</a> came flying to her. Then she asked him what he could do, and he told her that when
it was summer they always liked to listen to his singing. Then she told him he was
not good, and he flew from her.
</p>
<p>All kinds of birds, which she called for her daughter, wanted to marry her daughter.
She kept asking them what they could do, and she refused them.
</p>
<p>After that she again called for her daughter. She said: “Who will marry my daughter?”
And Deer came to her. “Why not I?” “What can you do?” “After I have traveled about
I scatter earth with my horns.” Then she refused him.
</p>
<p>When she called again Black-bear also came to her. She asked him: “What can you do?”
“I know how to catch fish. When I get angry with anything I strike it with my paws.”
“You are not good.” Then he also left her.
</p>
<p>When she again called Grizzly-bear also came to her. “Why not I?” “What can you do?”
“I am powerful. When I become angry with any sort of thing I tear it in pieces.” And
she said that he, too, was not good.
</p>
<p>When she shouted again Beaver came to her, and she asked him what he could do. Then
he told her he could fell trees, and he knew how to make a house in a lake. Then she
said to him also: “You are not good,” and he, too, left her.
</p>
<p>All the time she was asking for her daughter, all the forest animals wanted to marry
her daughter. Meanwhile she kept asking them what they could do. All that time she
refused them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>After that she again asked for her daughter: “Who will marry my daughter?” Then a
handsome man came and stood near her. “Why not I” “What can you do?” “I will help
you. I hear that they burned your uncle’s town.” Then she thought he was good.
</p>
<p>Immediately he took them up on either side. He said: “Let neither of you look out.”
Then he tried to climb a lofty mountain with them. After he had climbed for a while
with them, the mother looked out. She made him slide back. Again they stood below.
</p>
<p>After that he again told them not to look out. And again he started up with them.
Again the mother looked out, and they stood below. Every time he went up she looked
out and made him slide back. After he had tried many times, he pulled a limb out of
a tree and pushed her in in its place. “Future people will hear your voice” [he said],
and he left her, whereupon her voice sounded behind him. She is the creaking caused
by limbs rubbing together, they say.
</p>
<p>Then he went off with her (the daughter). And he brought her to his father’s house.
She had married the son of Supernatural-being-of-the-shining-heavens.<a class="noteRef" id="n343.6src" href="#n343.6">6</a> When he came in to his father with her, his father was very glad to see his wife.
</p>
<p>After he had lived with her for a while, she had a child by him. Again she brought
forth. Now she began to have children by him. She bore five boys and she bore one
girl.
</p>
<p>After she had reared them for a while, and they got to be of some height, their grandfather
taught them to gamble. After they had gambled for a while, they fought together, and
their sister put a belt on and tried to stop them by seizing their weapons. He kept
making them fight together all the time they were growing up.
</p>
<p>After they had been there for a while, their grandfather let them return home. Then
their grandfather brought out a box, and, after he had opened a nest of five boxes,
he gave them the innermost one. He directed them: “When you come to the place where
your uncle’s town used to stand, cover up your faces and pull off the cover from this
box. Even if you hear a great noise near you while you lie with your faces covered
over, do not look out. After the noise has ceased, look in that direction. And, when
a fight becomes too hard for you, pull off the box cover,” he said to them.
</p>
<p>Anew they started down. The five and their sister went down. But their mother still
remained with her husband. Then they came to the place where the town had been. Then
they lay under something, and they pulled the cover from the box. Although something
sounded near them they did not look out. When the noise ceased, they looked in the
direction whence it had proceeded. Six houses stood in a line.
</p>
<p>Then they started fires in all of these and began to live there. And those who had
burned the town saw people. Then they said: “In the place on the other side where
you burned up the town there is another <span class="pageNum" id="pb344">[<a href="#pb344">344</a>]</span>town with smoke coming out of all the houses. Let us go over and look at it.” Then
one went over and looked at it. In truth, people were living there.
</p>
<p>After they had lived on either side for a while, one went over to gamble. All that
time they were whittling. The youngest was left-handed. His grandfather had given
him a small wedge. He took good care of it. He also had a knife. And to his sister
her grandfather had given medicine. When her brothers were killed, he had told her
to spit medicine upon them.
</p>
<p>His elder brothers gambled, but he whittled near the fire. They kept asking him to
gamble. All that time he said: “I have nothing to stake.” “Stake against me the stone
wedge you own,” they said to him, and they laughed at him.
</p>
<p>By and by he started gambling. At once his sister put on her belt. For she knew he
would fight. He was the one who always started the fights when they lived with their
grandfather. After he had gambled for a while, lo! he began to fight with the one
he was gambling against. He had staked his stone wedge. Then he killed the one he
fought with.
</p>
<p>At once they ran apart. Those on the other side came to fight in a great crowd. After
they had fought with them for a while and were tired out, they went to get the box
and pulled off the cover. Then the town on the other side burned. They also destroyed
the people. They burned their town completely. When they killed her brothers she spit
medicine upon them, and they got up. She always had medicine in her mouth.
</p>
<p>When the fight was over they at once started down the valley of Nass river. After
they had traveled for a while, they came to a town at the mouth of the river. After
they had been there for a while, they began to make war toward the Tlingit country.
They destroyed some people, and they returned. That was the beginning of their wars.
</p>
<p>By and by they went to war regularly. Every time people pursued them they pulled the
box cover off, a strong wind arose, and the water burned. This was how they destroyed
people.
</p>
<p>After they had done this for a while, they went to the Stikine to make war. When they
pursued them that time, and a crowd of canoes was very near them, they pulled off
the box cover, but nothing happened. When they had started out to war, they took a
box like the right one. They left the one by means of which they destroyed people.
</p>
<p>Then all were destroyed there. Their bodies were thrown into the sea. The youngest,
who used to make people grieve by his deeds, they took to the shore, pushed a stick
through his anus, and stuck him up at the end of the town upon a point. In the evening
his voice <span class="pageNum" id="pb345">[<a href="#pb345">345</a>]</span>sounded, but still he was dead. This time they went to war they disappeared for a
long time.
</p>
<p>As soon as they had gone, their sister saw that they had forgotten the box. By means
of that they used to destroy many people. They had disappeared.
</p>
<p>Then they brought out the box, and his sister, along with their wives, went after
them. After they had gone on for a while, [they came to where] cedar bark grew, and
they pulled it off; and they forgot they had gone out to give assistance. And, after
they had gone on for a while longer, they remembered they had come out to help them.
That is why women talk themselves into forgetfulness.
</p>
<p>After that they went back. But now they went straight along. Then people came out
from the town to kill them. And, when they got close to them, they pulled off the
box cover, a strong wind arose, and the sea burned. So she destroyed the people. Then
they went away, and she pulled her brother off from where he was stuck in the ground,
spit medicine upon him, and brought him to life. At that time he went away with them.
There was no way of knowing where to look for the other brothers.
</p>
<p>After they had returned he who was left-handed went far inland. Something also took
away the box from them. After he had gone on for a while, he came to a lake far inland.
After having sat near it for a while, he saw something come out of it. It made a noise,
and its voice sounded loud. It always came to the surface at one spot.
</p>
<p>He had a stone ax with him. He chopped down a cedar and split it between its two heads.
Then he put a crosspiece in it and tied a twisted cedar rope to it.<a class="noteRef" id="n345.7src" href="#n345.7">7</a> And he pushed it out to the place where it (the creature) came out. After he had
looked at it for a while, he pulled the crosspiece out with the twisted cedar rope,
and something was caught in it. He pulled it ashore.
</p>
<p>Then he began to skin it. Every time he tried, the Forest-people<a class="noteRef" id="n345.8src" href="#n345.8">8</a> [said] he had better not do it. By and by he cut it open upon the breast and skinned
it. And he dried it. This was Loon, they say.
</p>
<p>Then he put it on. When he dived under water with it on, he saw all the things far
out under water. He came up, got out of it, put it into his armpit, and came out with
it toward the sea.
</p>
<p>After he had gone along for a while, he came to a town. After he had been there for
a while, he married a woman of the place. When they had lived there for a while, they
went up the Nass for eulachon. He also went with his father-in-law. On the way they
camped for a while. They were very hungry.
</p>
<p>Then he went behind the place where they were camping, entered his loon skin, and
went under water with it on. Under water were two hair seals. He took one and brought
it up. Then he stowed it away.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb346">[<a href="#pb346">346</a>]</span></p>
<p>Very early next day he went after firewood. Then he brought it in and took it up to
the camp. His father-in-law was very glad on account of it, and he called the people
for it.
</p>
<p>After that he again went after firewood, took his loon skin out from between the two
tree tops where he kept it, and put it on. Then he saw a halibut swimming along and
threw it ashore; and he brought it in. Again his father-in-law called the people for
it. Every time he went for firewood he brought in hair seal or halibut. Each time
his father-in-law called the people for them. By and by they went away.
</p>
<p>At that time some copper stuck out toward the sea from a cliff on Mount Qātcꜝig̣ᴀ′n.<a class="noteRef" id="n346.9src" href="#n346.9">9</a> Every time they went by there was a crowd of people below. All that time they wanted
to get it, and tried to bring it down with their arrows. When they did the same thing
below it this time, they (the hero and his people) were also among them.
</p>
<p>At that time a slave owned by his father-in-law shot at the copper with his sling.
Then he struck his master’s wife with the sling. And the slave became ashamed. That
is why slaves are ashamed when they make mistakes.
</p>
<p>But he (the hero) hit it with the sling. And when it came down his mother-in-law became
frightened and said something about having it go to the north. Thither it at once
went. That is why there is much copper to the north. If she had not been frightened,
there would have been very much copper in the Nass.
</p>
<p>Afterward they set out and camped again. And from there his wife, the slave, and himself
went after something. When they moved on they always wore their best clothes. Then
he left his good clothes in the canoe in order to get something. When he came back
the slave had put on his clothing and was sitting near his wife on the broad thwart
in the middle of the canoe. Then he did not want to make him ashamed, so he got in
at the stern and paddled them away. Because this chief’s son did so to them chiefs’
sons now do not like to make people ashamed.
</p>
<p>Here he again hid his skin in the fork of a tree. Then he again went for something.
And he put it on and saw spring salmon swimming about at the other side of the river.
He took one and brought it ashore. He brought it to the camp. His father-in-law also
called the people for that.
</p>
<p>Again he went for something, entered his loon skin, and brought out two. He also brought
those to camp. His father-in-law also invited the people for those. Every time the
slave went with him and saw how he used the skin.
</p>
<p>After he had done so at this place for a time he began to gamble. After he had lost
for a while he stopped and went to the house. His wife was gone from the house.<a class="noteRef" id="n346.10src" href="#n346.10">10</a> Then he went to where he kept his loon skin, and that too had disappeared.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb347">[<a href="#pb347">347</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he went down to the river. He looked into the water and saw his wife wearing
the loon skin lying with her arm round an old log in the river. After she had put
this [skin] on she thought she saw a spring salmon. She seized it. But [instead] she
seized an old log lying under water. There she was drowned.
</p>
<p>Then he pulled out his wife’s body and started inland in shame right opposite. She
alone knew what her husband did. And, after he was gone, the slave began doing the
same thing. Before he had done it for a long time, in going out to a spring salmon
which was swimming about, he disappeared for ever.
</p>
<p>This is why women always spoil things by meddling with them and by talking; [why]
slaves, too, are always ashamed when they make mistakes.

<p class="first center">[Told by Richard of the Middle-Gîtî′ns.]
</p>
<p>A chief in a certain town was married. Then he asked a good-looking woman in a neighboring
town in marriage. After a while he married her. On her account he rejected the one
he had first married, and she sat around in the corner of the house weeping.
</p>
<p>Then the uncles and the brothers of the one he had just married came to him, and he
gave them food. They were unable to consume the cranberries and berries of all kinds
which he gave them to eat. During the same time, his brothers-in-law<a class="noteRef" id="n348.1src" href="#n348.1">1</a> gave him much property.
</p>
<p>Once, when they went to bed, the one he disliked was weeping in the corner for her
dead child with pitch on her face. And in the night she went to one of the chief’s
brothers-in-law of medium age who had paint on his face and feathers on his head.
Then the woman rubbed herself against the paint upon his face, and she rubbed herself
upon his hair. Then she went to where she had been lying.
</p>
<p>Next morning the woman’s nose and face had paint upon them, and her face had feathers
upon it. And the man’s face also had spots of pitch upon it. Then the chief took to
his bed [with grief]. She did this because she wanted to see whether he had really
rejected her. Then his brothers-in-law went away.
</p>
<p>Some time after that he sent out to call his brothers-in-law, and his brothers-in-law
came to him. Then he gave them food. And they went to bed. All slept. Then he put
water on the fire, and he spilled it on them. And their bodies lay there motionless.
Then he dragged the dead bodies of his wife’s brothers<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n348.1asrc" href="#n348.1">1</a> and uncles<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n348.1bsrc" href="#n348.1">1</a> to the bases of the trees. And he again refused to have her.
</p>
<p>Now her mother (the mother of his second wife) was saved and cried about. She wept
continually, holding her arms toward the sky. Then the chief went to the town and
killed all the old people in it. And her mother went inland, made a house out of old
cedar bark at a certain mountain, and wept there. All that time she held her hands
toward the sky.
</p>
<p>By and by her thigh swelled up. Before ten nights had passed it burst, and a child
came out. Then she washed him. And not a long time afterward he wept for a bow. Then
she broke off a hemlock branch and made one for him. Then he went out and brought
in a wren.<a class="noteRef" id="n348.2src" href="#n348.2">2</a> He skinned it and dried the skin.
</p>
<p>The next time he went out he killed and brought in a song sparrow that went whistling
along. And he also skinned that. He went out <span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span>after that and brought in a robin,<a class="noteRef" id="n349.3src" href="#n349.3">3</a> and he ate its meat. There was nothing [else] to eat.
</p>
<p>After he had been bringing them in in this way for a while, one day he killed a black
bear. After he had killed all kinds of animals, he killed a grizzly bear. That he
also brought in to this mother.
</p>
<p>By and by he asked his mother: “Mother, why do you live here all alone?” Then she
said to her son: “My son, they destroyed your uncles. Your sister was married. Then
your uncles went to her. There they were destroyed. They also came after us. I escaped
from them. Therefore I am very careful where I go. I am afraid to look at the town.”
</p>
<p>Then he asked his mother: “Where is the town?” And she said to him: “It lies over
there.” And he said: “Mother, to-morrow, I am going to see it.” “Don’t, my child,
they will kill you also.” “Yet I will see it.”
</p>
<p>And next day he went down to see his sister. With his copper bow he went down to help
her. He had concealed it outside from his mother, they say, and, when he went out,
he threw away that she made for him just outside and took his own.
</p>
<p>Now he went to the town. And he sat behind it and thought of his sister. He had something
round his neck. It was made of copper. Then his sister came to him and he asked her
questions. He asked her how he treated her. And she told him that he treated her badly.
</p>
<p>Then he pulled off what he had round his neck and gave it to his sister. “Tell him
you found this for him. And, when it begins to burn a little, run out from him with
it and come to me again.”
</p>
<p>Then the woman went in and said: “Here is something I found for you.” When he took
it, fire flashed out from it, and she ran out from him. Then her brother handed her
his bow: “Say the same thing to him and run out from him.” Then she went in and she
gave him the copper bow. And at once she ran out. And behind her there was a great
noise of burning inside of the house. The whole town burned the way (i.e., as rapidly
as) a grouse flies away.<a class="noteRef" id="n349.4src" href="#n349.4">4</a> Not even one was saved out of it. He did it on account of his uncles.
</p>
<p>Then he went with his sister to where his uncles had had their town. And he asked
his sister: “Where do my uncles’<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n349.1src" href="#n348.1">1</a> bones lie?” And she said: “They lie behind the burned town.” Then they went there
and put their bones together. And, after he had spit medicine upon them four times,
they sat up. Then his uncles<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n349.1asrc" href="#n348.1">1</a> settled in the empty houses.
</p>
<p>Then he went to get his mother. Now his mother was already an old woman. And he spit
medicine over her, and she became young. Then he settled his mother down in the town.
And he spit medicine upon the old people they had killed, and they also became young.<a class="noteRef" id="n349.5src" href="#n349.5">5</a>
</p>
<p>And he went out in the evening and came in next morning, and he <span class="pageNum" id="pb350">[<a href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>told his mother he had killed a whale. And, when they went down to see it, a whale
lay there. Then the town people cut it up. And the next evening he went out and came
in in the morning. And he pulled some strings of halibut in in front of the town.
</p>
<p>One day he called the people. At that time he gave them all kinds of food. The things
in the trays were not consumed. Then they went away. Those he restored to youth were
married. Then he said: “I will give you ten whales to eat.” And, after they had returned
home and the next morning had come, ten whales were floating in front of the town.
</p>
<p>And after that he looked about in the <span class="corr" id="xd32e27568" title="Source: neigboring">neighboring</span> towns for a wife. In the evening he went out. He came in very early. All that time
he concealed the things with which he was born. Only his sister knew about them. By
and by he prepared to ask the chief’s daughter in a neighboring town in marriage.
Presently he was accepted and all the town people went with him to get her. And she
came in with him.
</p>
<p>Then his uncles gave him the town. And he frequently gave them food. When he sent
to call them in he told them to go out aimlessly and get things for him. It was as
if things flowed in through the doorway, and he fed them.
</p>
<p>After some time had passed he went to his father-in-law. Then all his uncles again
went with him. But instead of receiving him kindly they used supernatural powers against
him. Before anything they tried against him came to him, it was gone. By and by his
father-in-law pulled him against a cloak he wore which was covered with needles. Then
the needles dropped from it, and he threw it into the corner.
</p>
<p>Then he said: “Did you lie to me formerly?” And he began to give his son-in-law something
to eat. And, after he had got through feeding him, he arose very early next morning,
and, when he went to the fire, something near him made a thundering noise. Now he
sent his uncles home. And he remained behind. After he had received food there a while
he asked his father-in-law to take him over. Then he took him over, and his father-in-law
[returned without] going into the house. Then he said: “I am giving you ten whales.”
And the morning after they got back ten whales floated in front of the town.
</p>
<p>And he again feasted the people. By and by one of his uncles came in to him, saying
he was not in good circumstances. And he said to him (his uncle): “Live over there.
You will be well off over there.” And, after he had given his uncle food, he told
his uncle he had better go. “Go. You will cease being poorly off. When I have food
brought to you, invite your elder brothers.” He went at once. Food came in of itself
after him. Then he called the people for it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span></p>
<p>And then his wife became pregnant. And her thigh was swollen, as that of his mother
had been. Out of it came a woman. Within ten nights she started to walk. She was he
himself born again.
</p>
<p>And before he went away he stole a look at his father-in-law. Then he prepared to
leave [him]. “I will go to renew my town, which has become old.” And one evening he
started. He was gone for good.
</p>
<p>And he came to his town. His town was old, and he spit medicine upon it. It was as
it had been before. Then his wife went back to her father’s town.
</p>
<p>And one of his uncles who was in the town went out one evening. Something took him
up. Then he took their wives also to the town. That was the Moon who was helping them,
because she raised her hands and wept. Then he took all of his uncles up and let them
become his servants. There he took good care of them.
</p>
<p class="small">This was told me by an old man who had spent much of his youth among the Kaigani,
and it is probably a mainland story.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Jimmy Sterling of the Stᴀstas]
</p>
<p>A married woman consorted with a man. She grew to be very much in love with him. Her
child was rather a large boy. When he (her lover) went to visit her she said to him:
“I will let myself fall sick, and I will let myself die. I will tell them to place
me on a tree top. On the night when they place me there go quickly and get me. When
you get ready to come up for me get some wet, rotten wood, out of which the water
will run and which will just fit the box.”
</p>
<p>After she had gone with him for a while she let herself fall sick. She then gave her
husband directions: “When I die place me on the top of a tree. I do not want to be
on the ground.” As soon as she died they put her into the box and put a strong cord
around it. They then put her between the two tops of a tree.
</p>
<p>He who was in love with her went at once to her in the night. As soon as he had found
some wet wood he untied the ropes which were around her and let her out. He then put
the wet, rotten wood in her place. She had told him to do this in order that the water
might drip out of the wood and they might think that it was the grease from her body.
</p>
<p>He then told the woman where to wait for him the next day. And he let her go before
him. On the next day he went after her. He told his friends that he was going to get
furs.
</p>
<p>They at once set out to go far inland; and, after they had traveled about for a while,
he built a house for them far inland, and they began to live there.
</p>
<p>Her husband constantly came weeping with her child to the place where she had been
placed on high. By and by [what he supposed was] the grease from her body began to
run down. That was the liquid running out of the rotten wood. The man who went for
furs disappeared moreover. His friends thought that a grizzly bear had killed him.
</p>
<p>Where they stayed, far inland, there was plenty of all kinds of animals, which he
killed for them. They had plenty of all kinds of berries and salmon. And they wore
hides sewed together. They became like Wood Indians.<a class="noteRef" id="n352.1src" href="#n352.1">1</a>
</p>
<p>Moreover, they began there to sing songs. The woman danced the whole time. She also
made up new words. During all that time she taught her husband. She made up new words
in order that when she went back they should not know her. After they had stayed there
many years they went away. They carried on their backs skins <span class="pageNum" id="pb353">[<a href="#pb353">353</a>]</span>of all kinds of animals prepared in unusual ways. Furthermore, the woman dressed herself
differently. She wore things such as the Wood Indians wear. But the man did not dress
himself so. They now came back to the town.
</p>
<p>The man said that he had come to a town while he was hunting far inland, had there
married the woman, and had remained there. One night he said that his wife would dance.
All the while she spoke the words that she had composed for her husband. But her husband
said that it was her language.
</p>
<p>All the people of the town then went into the house where she was, and she began to
dance before them. Her dances and her songs were strange. Nevertheless she made them
desire to come in and look at her.
</p>
<p>Whenever she danced her former husband and her child came and looked on with them.
When she ceased her dancing she pointed her finger at her child and said something.
Her husband then explained her words. She said, [he explained], that she had a child
like him in her own country. She then called her child, and she cried.
</p>
<p>When she first danced her former husband recognized the motions that she used to make,
and her voice. Although he recalled the one who was dead, he did not believe that
it was she. That was why he continually went to look. Because she kept them up all
night to see her dance they were all asleep in the morning. They learned her songs.
</p>
<p>After a while, having positively identified his wife, he climbed up to where she had
been put and untied the box cover. Only rotten wood was there. Some time after he
had seen this, very early one morning after she had danced, while they still slept,
he went thither. Then, after he had pulled from her face the thing that she wore as
a hat as she slept, he saw it was his wife. And while they slept he killed them both.

<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o.]
</p>
<p>At Qꜝadō′ a certain person fell in love with a woman. She then refused to have him,
but she told him to pull out his hair, and then she would fall in love with him. He
went again to talk to her. She then told him to pull out his eyebrows and his eyelashes;
she would then fall in love with him. After that he went again to speak with her.
That time she told him to pull out his mustache and the hair on his body. Only then,
[she said], would she fall in love with him. After that he again went to her. Then
she absolutely refused him.
</p>
<p>He ceased going abroad among the people. When he needed anything he always went out
at night. He began to work inside. He whittled. After he had done this for a while
he had filled two boxes. And<span class="corr" id="xd32e27632" title="Source: .">,</span> when a moonlight night came, he went out.
</p>
<p>He then shot the sky. He picked up another arrow and shot it into the notch of the
first. He did the same thing again and again. After he had shot away his two boxfuls
it hung a bow’s length from the ground, and he laid the bow upon them. He at once
went up upon it.
</p>
<p>After mounting for some time he came to a town. That was the Moon’s town, they say.
After he had gone about the town for a while some one said to him out of a big house:
“Your grandfather invites you in.” And he entered. He (the Moon) then had him sit
at his right hand in the rear of the house.
</p>
<p>After he had sat for a while looking at him, as he sat near him, he had a box brought
to him. He saw that all of his hair was gone. At that time he saw only one box. After
he had pulled them apart five times he took a small comb out of the inmost one.
</p>
<p>He then had water brought and began to make his face look as it ought to look. Each
time he wet his hands he rubbed them upon his eyes. When he had made him good-looking
he began to comb his hair. He ran the comb down along half of his head, and when it
had passed below he took it off. And after he had done this to him three times he
stopped. After that he also made his eyebrows with the comb, and his eyelashes, and
he also brought out his mustache.
</p>
<p>When he first came in he said to him: “Grandson, news had come that you were going
to come up to let me set you to rights. I will make you quite proper.<span class="corr" id="xd32e27641" title="Not in source">”</span>
</p>
<p>He straightway made him good-looking. He finished him. He was there many nights. Then
he gave the chief directions: “When the one that you loved, who made you pull out
your hair, comes with <span class="pageNum" id="pb355">[<a href="#pb355">355</a>]</span>the others to look at you do not turn your face toward her. Turn your back to her.”
</p>
<p>He then went down again upon the arrows. Now he sat erect in his father’s house, and
all the town of Qꜝadō′ came in to look at him. Then the one with whom he had been
in love looked in at him, and he turned his back upon her. By and by, fascinated by
the sight of him, she died.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Jackson, late chief of Skidegate.]
</p>
<p>He had ten uncles. They gathered food at a certain salmon creek. Then he went up,
got very many salmon, and filled his canoe. An eagle sat on a sand bar. He split open
the salmon, threw them off there, and paddled away with an empty canoe. On the next
day he again went out, split the salmon open, and threw them off. After a long time
the people came to know about the eagle.
</p>
<p>They then gathered all kinds of berries. His mother was a widow. His mother looked
after his youngest uncle’s wife. For that reason he picked wild crab apples and cranberries
and gave them to his uncle’s wife. And, when they moved away, since he and his mother
had done the best that they could for his youngest uncle’s wife, they stayed with
them. The minds of the rest of his uncles became different toward him, because he
had gathered food for the eagle.
</p>
<p>Now they came to the town. After they had stayed in the town for some time, and it
was spring, they became hungry. He then went to the wife of one of his uncles, but
she said to him: “Live upon the food that you gathered for the eagle.” He went out
and entered another house. There they said the same thing to him. He went into the
houses of his ten uncles, and every time they said the same thing to him. When he
went into the house of his youngest uncle’s wife, they gave him the dorsal fin of
a salmon, and he chewed it.
</p>
<p>Now, when it was near the end of spring, they moved away from him. They did not leave
even a small piece of old cedar bark in the town. And his youngest uncle’s wife explained
to his mother. “When they start off, dig about in the place where I sit down to defecate.”
</p>
<p>Now, when they pushed off, she was the last. And he dug about in the place where she
had sat to defecate. He then found a bag holding a humpback split open and small pieces
of food of various kinds. That was the only food obtainable where they were.
</p>
<p>And his youngest uncle left them a little old canoe. And the boy also started off,
not knowing whither he was going.<a class="noteRef" id="n356.1src" href="#n356.1">1</a>
</p>
<p class="center">[Told by Wī′nats, chief of the Seaward-gîtî′ns.]
</p>
<p>Far away from where they left him was a rock. One day a young eagle sat on the top
of the rock. When it flew away, he (the boy) went to the place. Beside the rock lay
the tail of a spring salmon. He picked it up and brought it to his mother. She steamed
it, and they drank the soup.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb357">[<a href="#pb357">357</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next day he again looked toward the place where the eagle had sat. It sat there
again. And he again went thither. A larger piece lay there than the one he had found
before. Every morning they became larger until a whole spring salmon lay there.
</p>
<p>One day, just at dawn,<a class="noteRef" id="n357.2src" href="#n357.2">2</a> he looked for the eagle that helped him. It sat there, and he went thither and found
a porpoise tail lying there. He then took it to the house, and she (his mother) steamed
it. There was a larger piece every morning until a whole one lay there.
</p>
<p>One day the eagle sat there again, and he went thither. The tail of a black whale
lay there. He cut it up and took it over to the house. The pieces of whale became
larger every time until a whole one lay there. Then there were more whales. At last
there were ten.
</p>
<p>Then the slaves of his uncles went out to look for him. He felt their presence, brought
them to the house, and gave them some food. And he watched them while they ate. He
watched to see that they did not hide any mouthfuls. When they went away he told them
not to say that he was being helped. And they went off.
</p>
<p>The slaves returned home. They said that they had not seen him. They then went to
bed. In the night something choked the child of the head slave, and they made a light
for him. They tried to take out the object with their fingers. They pulled something
fat out of his mouth. They then put it on a hot stone. It sizzled.
</p>
<p>They then began to ask them about the thing, and they answered: “You ought to see
how the one you abandoned is living. Black whales are floated ashore in front of him
like driftwood.”
</p>
<p>His uncles then dressed up their daughters, because each thought he would have his
nephew marry his child. But the daughter of his youngest uncle was lame. She was the
one who had left food for him. They then went to him, but he refused the women and
waited for the one who was lame.
</p>
<p>Her father brought her last. And he invited her father into his own house. He then
married her. She was not pretty, but he married her because she had left food for
him.<a class="noteRef" id="n357.3src" href="#n357.3">3</a> And because the woman helped him to live coals he brought down food to her father.
But his nine [remaining] uncles began to buy food from him. Because he gathered food
for the eagle they (the daughters) did not marry him. For that reason he, too, would
not give them food.
</p>
<p class="small">This is said to be the family story of a Tsimshian family called Nîstoy. As the two
parts were obtained from different sources there are several inconsistencies, and
I suspect that the first story-teller would have completed the tale somewhat differently.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Jimmy Sterling of the Stᴀstas.]
</p>
<p>He used to say that he would not let himself become a gā′gix̣īt as others had done.
One time he went to get firewood. He went alone. Only a dog that he owned was with
him. After cutting firewood for a while he filled his canoe and went away. While he
was on the way a strong wind came upon him. He then upset.
</p>
<p>Then he and his dog got safely ashore. He had cut the firewood with a stone ax. As
he swam he held it in his mouth. As soon as he reached safety he began to cut firewood.
He was handling heavy things and warmed himself by doing so. He also cut hemlock limbs
and made a house.
</p>
<p>After he had been busy at this for a while, and had finished it, he started to make
fire with a drill. When it burned he built a large fire in front of himself. At the
time when he reached safety he found a flat stone, and, whenever he would sit down,
he sat upon it. When evening came he sat on it near the fire.
</p>
<p>When he first saved himself he saw a large fire at some distance, and near it a crowd
of people talking. He longed to go to it, but he steadfastly set his mind against
it. He had heard that when one goes to it the fire goes before him, and he goes on
forever. That was why he did not go to it.
</p>
<p>In the evening, when his fire and his house were ready, he killed his dog, and he
skinned it. He cut it open along the breast. He then left its skull there. And he
rubbed its blood upon his face, head, and body. He pulled out an ulna and ground it
on a stone. After it had become sharp he constantly kept it in his hand. Evening now
came upon him.
</p>
<p>After he had sat near the fire for a while something came and rapped on the place
where he was sitting. The creature that makes people gā′gix̣īts<a class="noteRef" id="n358.1src" href="#n358.1">1</a> came and rapped in order to go into his anus. When it could not get in it kept saying
to him: “Ho Qō′łkꜝē’s anus is closed tight.” He did not see it; he only heard its
voice.
</p>
<p>At the time when he upset it turned dry and cold. It was north weather. During the
whole time he remained awake all night long. He was afraid to sleep. When day came
he stopped up the chinks in his house. He then cut a block of wood and hollowed it.
He wanted to urinate in that only, and in that he did urinate. Again he stopped up
all the crannies in the house very tight. Again night came upon him.
</p>
<p>During all that time wherever he sat down he had the stone with <span class="pageNum" id="pb359">[<a href="#pb359">359</a>]</span>him. He always sat upon it. During all that time something tried to get into his anus.
Something kept saying to him: “Ho Qō′łkꜝē’s anus is closed tight.” He only heard the
voice.
</p>
<p>When night came upon him he sat near the fire. During all that time he let it burn
every night. After he had sat there for a while, a woman came in to him holding in
her hand a basket containing something. “Brother Qō′łkꜝē, I bring food for you.” She
gave him chitons.
</p>
<p>He then was glad. He set them in front of himself, and he had her sit on the opposite
side of the fire. He then took out one and put it into the fire. Then, however, wood
ticks ran away from the fire. He then threw all into the fire. There was nothing but
wood ticks running away. He then gave her her bucket. She now said to him: “Hu, brother
Qō′łkꜝē,” and she went away from him.
</p>
<p>He wore on his head the skin of the dog, showing its teeth. The rest of the skin hung
down his back. He was covered with blood. He was not agreeable to look at. During
all that time the north wind blew strongly. In the place from whence he had gone after
wood they were troubled about him, but the wind was too strong. There was no way to
search for him.
</p>
<p>On the next evening something again came to him with food. That time it brought mussels
to him. He put those, too, into the fire. Minks ran away from it. For a second time
he returned to her her empty basket. A mink which had changed itself into a woman
brought him food. They gave it to him in order that when he ate it he would become
a gā′gix̣īt. But he was too cunning. Although he knew that something had changed its
form [to harm him], he did not touch it (the woman).
</p>
<p>During all that time something kept tapping upon his buttocks. During all that time
it could not get into him, and it said: “Ho Qō′łkꜝē’s anus is stopped up tight.” But
he only heard the voice. He always held the dog’s ulna. And he did not let the stone
ax go. The woman came in every evening. He had her then sit directly opposite to himself.
</p>
<p>At one time, when she came in to him, she brought him the following news: “To-morrow
your friends are going to come for you.” During all that time he urinated nowhere
but in his box. On the next day many people, as many as ten, came to him by canoe.
In it his sister sang a crying song: “Ha, brother Qō′łkꜝē.” He looked out of the hemlock
house.
</p>
<p>During all that time he wore the dog’s head. Again he did not sleep. While they were
still out at sea he went down to meet them. When they got in front of him, in truth,
his younger brothers were there. His sister was also there. He recognized them all.
They feared for some time to go in to him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb360">[<a href="#pb360">360</a>]</span></p>
<p>And, after they had remained there for a while, they came in to him. Then, as he pulled
it up, he thrust the dog’s bone into the end of the canoe. It went in easily. And,
when he passed down to the middle, the same thing took place there. The whole canoe
was like that.
</p>
<p>Then all got off, and he tied all their paddles together and went up to the house
with them. He then brought them into the house and stood them on end near the door.
He then had the canoe people sit in a circle. His sister sat with them next to the
door.
</p>
<p>And he intended to let them wash their hands in urine after they had sat there for
a while. He put it first in front of the one nearest to the door. While he washed
his hands he turned his head away and snuffled. As each washed his hands he did the
same thing. He then knew that these were Land-otter people. He picked up his urinal
and put it back into its place behind him.
</p>
<p>After that he put the paddles into the fire. Lo! minks ran away. When he clubbed those
that had come after him, they did not any longer conceal the fact that they were land
otters. He straightway placed himself just inside the door and clubbed the land otters
to death. But he did not touch the woman. The Land-otter people changed themselves
to make him a gā′gix̣īt. If he had gone with them he would have become a gā′gix̣īt.
</p>
<p>During all that time he fasted. Again he did not sleep. He feared to. During all that
time the woman brought him food. And every time he put it into the fire different
things ran away from it.
</p>
<p>At one time, when she came in to him, she again said that they would come for him.
By and by ten more persons came after him in a canoe. Again a woman sang a crying
song in it. “Brother Qō′łkꜝē” were the words she put into it. He again went down.
Those, too, were afraid for some time to come in to him.
</p>
<p>By and by they came in. He recognized all. When he pulled up their canoe he also stuck
his dog’s bone into it, and it went in easily. He gathered all their paddles together,
bound them, and went up with them. He again stood them on end near the door. As before,
he told the canoe people to sit on each side of him. He again seated his sister nearest
to the door.
</p>
<p>Then he again had them wash their hands in urine. He saw them again turn their heads
away as they washed. He saw that these were also land otters. He again rose and put
their paddles into the fire. They all ran off again as minks. He stood then in the
doorway and began to club the land otters. Again he preserved the woman only.
</p>
<p>During all that time it was north weather.<a class="noteRef" id="n360.2src" href="#n360.2">2</a> Soon after he had killed these there was fine weather. The wind had been strong for
ten days. When it was a fine day his friends really came in search of him. He went
to them. Without waiting, they came up in front of him.
</p>
<p>Then he tried to push his bone into the canoe bow. He could not. <span class="pageNum" id="pb361">[<a href="#pb361">361</a>]</span>And he knew it was a real canoe. But he still did not believe that they were his friends.
He also gathered their paddles together and took them up to the house. He again stood
them near the door. He again told the people to sit opposite him.
</p>
<p>Then he took up the urine and had them wash their hands in it. The one in front of
whom he first put it now washed his hands in it after the usual fashion. His sister
was really in the canoe with them. Those who had come before were only like her. When
they got through washing he shoved their paddles into the fire. They burned, and one
of them rose quickly and pulled them out.
</p>
<p>And, after he had sat there for a while, he rose quickly and struck at the one sitting
next to him, who caught his club overhead. During all that time he wore the skin.
They were afraid to look at him. During all that time he also fasted. He always remained
awake. He was nothing but bones.
</p>
<p>During all that time they talked to him: “Qō′łkꜝē, it is we. Come with us.” He struck
at one who was near him, and they caught his club above him. All at once he started
to go with them. He had fought all the ten canoe people. The canoes of those who had
come before had turned into large logs.
</p>
<p>He now embarked with them. After he had gone along for a while with them he struck
at the one next to him with his stone ax. Every time they caught it above themselves.
They came to the town with him. When the townspeople came down to meet him he also
tried to fight with them. They stopped him quickly every time.
</p>
<p>When he came into the house they gave him some salmon to eat. He put one piece into
the fire. It burned, and he put it back [into the dish]. After he had sat there for
another space of time he struck at the one who sat next to him, and they quickly stopped
him. During the whole time they called to him: “Qō′łkꜝē.” He also kept the stone under
his anus whenever he sat down. When evening came he was afraid to lie with his wife.
He even tried to kill his wife. But the next day he ate in the usual manner. He put
a part of all the things he ate into the fire. When it burned, he ate of it. They
[the land otters] were unable to get him.

<p>II. Song-sparrow<a class="noteRef" id="n362.2src" href="#n362.2">2</a> lived with his grandmother. Whenever his grandmother soaked salmon Grizzly-bear<a class="noteRef" id="n362.3src" href="#n362.3">3</a> stole the soaked salmon. One day Song-sparrow saw Grizzly-bear doing this. He said
then to his grandmother: “Grandmother, I will kill him.” And his grandmother said
to him: “Do not try, my child; he will swallow you.” “That will be all right, grandmother,
for I shall have a fire drill in his belly.”
</p>
<p>He then made a bow and arrows. The people did not like him and his grandmother. By
and by, when Grizzly-bear came there again, he shot him. He did not know then what
happened to him. And, when he was in his belly, he came to himself. He then thought
of his fire drill and made a fire in his belly. When it burned it burned through his
belly. And he killed Grizzly-bear.
</p>
<p>He then brought the news to his grandmother. “Grandmother, I have killed Grizzly-bear.”
And his grandmother told him that he lied. Then he went again to it and cut some pieces
from it. As soon as he showed it to his grandmother his grandmother put on her belt.
He and his grandmother began at once to cut it up.
</p>
<p>After they had taken all into the house he went to the neighboring town for some live
coals. When he came through the doorway they asked him: “What do you come for, Song-sparrow?”
And he said: “I come for live coals, skia′ldjîgut skā′ldjigut skētcꜝē′gut.”<a class="noteRef" id="n362.4src" href="#n362.4">4</a> After he had said this he spat out the blood of a piece of the grizzly bear that
he had in his mouth.
</p>
<p>They were surprised at this, and the townspeople ran toward his house. They took away
at once all of the grizzly bear. As he also ran toward it he said to his grandmother:
“Grandmother, keep hold of the biggest piece.” And, while he was running, they took
all of his meat away.
</p>
<p>After he and his grandmother had cried for a while his grandmother went to sleep.
Then, while his grandmother slept, he cut off his grandmother’s vulva. And he put
grease and feathers upon the place. He then cooked this. And when it was cooked his
grandmother woke up. “Grandmother, get up. I found a small thing in the dirt of the
trail where they have been walking. I cooked it for you.” His grandmother got up at
once and ate it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb363">[<a href="#pb363">363</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he took his grandmother’s urinal and went up to the top of the house with it.
And he used his grandmother’s urinal as a drum. He began then to sing: “Ha′haha hē′eee,
grandmother ate her cut-off vulva. In the place [I put] grease. In the place [I put]
feathers.” His grandmother then used hard words toward him: “He was born at the roots
of the salmon-berry bushes.<a class="noteRef" id="n363.5src" href="#n363.5">5</a> He is a wizard. He was born at the roots of the ferns.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n363.5asrc" href="#n363.5">5</a> He is a wizard.”
</p>
<p class="center">[The following version of the latter was obtained by Prof. Franz Boas]
</p>
<p>Once upon a time a boy and his grandmother lived in a hut made of twigs. The boy was
always going out to shoot birds. One day he saw a large bear, which he tried to kill
with his arrows. Then the bear snuffed him in. The old woman waited in vain for her
grandson, and finally thought he had died. The boy was not dead.
</p>
<p>While he was in the bear’s stomach, he thought: “I wish grandmother’s fire drill would
come to me!” It came at once. He made a fire in the bear’s stomach, which killed him.
He then carved the carcass and carried the meat to his grandmother’s house, which
he filled entirely. The old woman had no fire; therefore she sent her grandson to
the town to ask for some fire. Before he left he cut off a piece of the meat and took
it into his mouth. He then went to the door of one of the houses. He put down a piece
of skin near the fire, chewed the meat which he had taken along, and spit the fat
into the fire, so that it blazed up. The people asked him: “What are you holding in
your mouth?” He then showed them the bear’s meat. Then they all went to his grandmother’s
house, and they received presents of meat and of fat. They distributed almost all
of it.
</p>
<p>He then said to his grandmother: “Gather some fuel.” She did so, and started a fire.
Then the old woman fell asleep sitting near the fire. While she was asleep the boy
cut off a piece of her vulva and put down upon the wound. When she woke the next morning
he sent her again to gather fuel; and, while she was away, he roasted at the fire
the piece that he had cut from her body. When his grandmother returned he said to
her: “I roasted a little of the bear meat for you.” She entered, and he gave her her
own flesh to eat. As soon as she had eaten it he ran out, singing: “Grandmother ate
her own vulva!”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Richard of the Middle-gîtî′ns]
</p>
<p>Qä′ndawas was going to make a potlatch in Masset. She owned ten slaves. And she had
eight storehouses in the Kaigani country.<a class="noteRef" id="n364.1src" href="#n364.1">1</a> She was going to have [her property] brought over from there.
</p>
<p>And she owned a copper plate worth ten slaves. She intended to sell it for that price
in the Tsimshian country. They offered her nine slaves and an 8-fathom canoe. Thereupon
she said that she would not part with it because there were not ten slaves. They then
returned. And they came to Raven creek.<a class="noteRef" id="n364.2src" href="#n364.2">2</a>
</p>
<p>And, after they had sailed from there to House-point<a class="noteRef" id="n364.3src" href="#n364.3">3</a> with a south wind, a strong land breeze came upon them (i.e., a west wind). They
were then carried away. And it carried them to the Kaigani country, where some Tlingit
were gathering seaweed. Then the Tlingit invited them in. And they got off. After
they had given them food they killed them.
</p>
<p>The slaves saw then that they killed those who were on shore, and the five who had
remained to take care of the canoe put up the sails. And, after they had sailed along
for a while, they ran upon a reef and capsized there. The canoe, filled with the property,
then sank. It was a 10-fathom canoe.
</p>
<p>Thinking of this while we were growing up, we grew up to war with the Tlingit.<a class="noteRef" id="n364.4src" href="#n364.4">4</a> In the very middle of winter we began to drink medicine, and right from Qa-itg̣a′og̣ao,<a class="noteRef" id="n364.5src" href="#n364.5">5</a> where we were fishing for black cod, we went to war in two canoes. We camped for
the night at Kwaitg̣ᴀ′nʟ.<a class="noteRef" id="n364.6src" href="#n364.6">6</a> On the following night we camped at La-ut-g̣ᴀ′nʟ̣as.<a class="noteRef" id="n364.7src" href="#n364.7">7</a> On the next day we crossed.
</p>
<p>And, while it was yet daylight, we came in sight of the rocks along shore. We then
waited for night. And, when evening came, we went in to land. At daylight we pulled
up the canoes. Then we drank there four buckets of salt water. We were thirsty and
ran to the fresh water, and we drank fresh water out of spruce bark sewed together
and ran to the sea.<a class="noteRef" id="n364.8src" href="#n364.8">8</a>
</p>
<p>And, keeping a sharp lookout unobserved by them we saw four people going along in
a canoe. And, after they were gone, we drew up our canoes again. There I smoked, after
which I was dying of thirst. They did not think it well to put fresh water on me then,<a class="noteRef" id="n364.9src" href="#n364.9">9</a> and they put sea water on me.
</p>
<p>After that we went to look for people. We knew that people lived there. Then we saw
smoke far up the inlet. And when evening came we started thither. Just before daybreak
the canoes <span class="pageNum" id="pb365">[<a href="#pb365">365</a>]</span>came in front of it. There were four houses there. Below was a long stretch of steep
shore.
</p>
<p>And, when we got off, A′nkustᴀ<a class="noteRef" id="n365.10src" href="#n365.10">10</a> whipped the peoples’ souls. He then told us to go up to look at the houses. And two
persons went to look. Just as they got there a big dog barked at them. And when they
came back A′nkustᴀ performed again. He then pretended to tie fast the dog’s mouth.
And he said: “Now, friends, go to look at the houses again. Now, although he sees
you, he will not bark.”
</p>
<p>I then went with two others to look. Only a mat hung in the doorway. I lay down in
the doorway. They were snoring in the house. And, having fastened my knife upon my
hand, I entered. I found by feeling that there were only women there.
</p>
<p>And, after we had come to where our people were sitting, I said: “Chiefs that I have
for elder brothers, strengthen yourselves.” They then divided to enter the house.
And they said: “Huk” (“Go on”).<a class="noteRef" id="n365.11src" href="#n365.11">11</a> I let Xᴀ′nxaogu′tg̣as go ahead, and his younger brother followed me.
</p>
<p>And, when we were about to run in, I looked toward the beach [and saw] that, instead
of coming after us, they were preparing to shoot. We started away then in disgust.
We got into the canoe. There they asked us why we came down. And we almost came to
a quarrel.
</p>
<p>We then started off. And, when we landed among the driftwood, Gana′-i’s canoe came
up behind us. They were going to land after us among the driftwood. He said then:
“Come, friends; light a fire here for the sockeyes, which are good to eat.” But I
scolded them for it,<a class="noteRef" id="n365.12src" href="#n365.12">12</a> and they got in against their will.
</p>
<p>And they remained there still. And, after they had talked for a while about parting
company with the other canoe, I said: “My father-in-law is a chief. If those who have
been in your company kill people and he receives nothing, you will feel sorry for
it. Let us go down the inlet after them.”
</p>
<p>We then followed them down. After we had gone along for a while Gana′-i’s canoe passed
out of the inlet around a point. I then said: “Let us paddle after them. Paddle after.
Paddle after. They might meet somebody.”
</p>
<p>And, when they had nearly rounded another point, they pulled back. Some time after
that guns sounded, and they went ashore. Some Tlingit came then in a big canoe. They
stood in lines in the middle. There were a great number of guns in this. We then started
out to head them off.
</p>
<p>As they paddled away from us they shot at us twice, when something struck me in the
head and I lost consciousness. I came to myself lying in the canoe. By and by, after
I grew stronger and had fastened my knife upon my hand, they said to me: “G̣ᴀ′nx̣oat
was killed.” I then looked at him. He was hanging over into the water. And I told
them not to let him fall in.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb366">[<a href="#pb366">366</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Tlingit then shouted at us. They made a noise on the edges of their canoe: “A′lala
a′lala.” Upon this Gā′ala stood up in ours, and he shot the man in the stern, so that
he fell into the water. Then we said the same. We, too, said: “A′lala a′lala.” When
they shot me two bullets went through the skin of my head.
</p>
<p>And, when Skᴀ′ngwai’s father stood up and aimed at the one next to the stern, who
was paddling and moving his head as he did so, and shot him, he also fell upon his
face in the bailing place. We then again said the same thing. We rapped on the edges
of our canoe, saying at the same time: “A′lala.” And, when he shot again, another
cried out in it. They stood in lines in the middle of the canoe. Others paddled at
the sides. They then bade us cease shooting. They motioned us away with their hands.
We did then accordingly. The canoe was so large that the people in it could not be
counted.
</p>
<p>Then Gana′-i’s canoe went quickly to it. And, when they got close by, a Tlingit in
the middle stood up with a gun. He pointed at this one and that one among them. Someone
in Gana′-i’s canoe speared him with a bone spear that had a short handle. He dropped
the gun. The Tlingit then quickly sat down. He pulled out the spear. His intestines
came out at the same time. He broke it. And, when he started to shove the spear back
into the wound, someone in Gana′-i’s canoe jumped in to him, and the people in the
canoe stood up.
</p>
<p>Then our canoe went thither. And I went to the bow and jumped into it. All had long
knives. I fell in the stern. And the one I fell near stabbed me. When he struck my
shoulder I felt my insides come together [with pain]. Nevertheless I struck him in
the side, and his insides fell upon me. After that another one came toward me from
the bow. I stabbed him also in the side. When I struck him again he died.
</p>
<p>After that another came at me. When he tried to stab me I dodged him. And when I struck
him he grew pale. I told Gā′ala, who came behind me, to kill him. A youth having no
knife then made with his hands the motion of surrender to me from the bow. And I picked
him up, and I threw him into our canoe. When another came at me I struck him. It grazed
him. He went at once into our canoe. He let himself be enslaved. I made a cut down
his back. He was a brave man. People did not pass in front of his town. They were
afraid of him. When it was reported that he had let himself be enslaved the Tlingit
became boneless [with astonishment]. They did not believe it. His name was Yāñ.
</p>
<p>After we had fought for a while some one called to me from the middle: “So-and-so’s
grandfather, they are too much for me.” I then ran to him. And they had one of our
friends in the bottom of the canoe. A Tlingit whose knife had dropped from him was
moving it toward himself with his feet when I struck him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb367">[<a href="#pb367">367</a>]</span></p>
<p>And while I was striking one after another some one shouted to me from the stern.
A Tlingit was lying upon one of our young men. And, pushing away his knife, I cut
off his head. After that I saw some one who got in out of our canoe and a Tlingit
strike each other at the same time. The Tlingit fell upon his breast. Some time after
that he (the Haida) called to me: “So-and-so’s grandfather, they have broken my arm.”
I looked at him. There was a wound in his right arm. They shot him from beneath hides
lying near. I did not hear the sound of the gun. Neither did he hear it. Those who
were with us instead [of helping us] stood near looking on. They were afraid.
</p>
<p>After we had fought for a while, and had killed nearly all, I ran to the bow. The
many women, who sat in two places, I pushed apart. I passed between them to the bow.
Then the one who had concealed himself in the bow rose. When he was about to strike
me, I struck him in the side. He at once tried to close with me. I kept striking him.
By and by he died.
</p>
<p>And in the stern out of Gana′-i’s canoe they struck a certain one. He jumped then
into the water and struck the edges of the canoe with his knife. They jumped upon
the Tlingit and stabbed him.
</p>
<p>And after I had gone about in the bow for a while I looked toward the stern. They
were already pulling in slaves. And when I went thither I saw a woman left. She had
been shot in one leg. And I did not take her. One that I had struck acted as if he
were crazy. Then I jumped into [our canoe], and, when I was about to stab him, he
held up his hands to me. I then tied his legs together with a rope, and I tied his
hands behind his back.
</p>
<p>The property was captured at once. Into Gana′-i’s canoe they took ten severed heads.
There were only nine slaves. And after Skᴀ′ngwai’s father had brought five heads into
ours they found fault. He stopped then. And they took all the property.
</p>
<p>In front of the place whence we had been wrangling a whale swam about with its young
one. And we shot at the young one. We killed the young one. We took its oil to Port
Simpson<a class="noteRef" id="n367.13src" href="#n367.13">13</a> to trade. There we bought all kinds of stuff. We carried the things away. And, when
the canoes were filled with property, some was left behind.
</p>
<p>The warriors now got in. And, as they went along, they began to sing war songs. It
was hard for me. Two of my younger brothers were killed, and I sang differently from
them.
</p>
<p>When they were almost out of the inlet some one shouted “Ix̣iâ′⁺ī, they are pursuing
us.” Full canoes were behind us. The canoes were close together. They were brave in
Sg̣ā′gia’s canoe (the narrator’s). And the people in Gana′-i’s canoe began to paddle
away from us. I then stood up and I said: “Chiefs whom I have for fathers-in-law and
my sons-in-law’s nephews, do not tell a bad story <span class="pageNum" id="pb368">[<a href="#pb368">368</a>]</span>about us. For that we are out here. That is why they will kill us. Before they destroy
us we will destroy a whole canoe load of them.”
</p>
<p>After we had paddled away for a while in fright I looked back. Instead of my seeing
them they were gone. It was nothing but driftwood, on the top of which sea gulls sat.
</p>
<p>Then the people of Gana′-i’s canoe started a fire in a creek where there were many
humpbacks. There they roasted humpbacks for us. When we were done eating we went away.
We also gave food to the Tlingits.
</p>
<p>We then went to Cape Charcon. [We crossed, and], while we were going along together,
some one ahead of us shouted: “What warriors are those?” Then Skᴀ′ngwai’s father said:
“These are Sg̣ā′gia’s warriors.” And they came out from their concealment. They had
guns with red outsides (i.e., new ones) and two cartridge boxes apiece. No one could
touch me [I was so dirty]. I had on a white shirt, and I wore a blanket doubled. Where
they ate humpbacks I tied cedar bark round the arm of the man that they shot. And
the one shot in the head also returned to life. He told us he would not die for some
time yet.
</p>
<p>And, when we came round the point, they came down in a crowd opposite us. They had
had a Kaisun man living at Masset question us. They gave him the following directions.
“If you recognize them ask them ‘Is it you?’ and if you do not know them ask ‘What
warriors are those?’ ” That was the way in which he questioned us. They then called
ashore from our canoe a Masset man who was born in the same place with a certain one
[of them]. We four stayed then in the canoe. But no one got out of Gana′-i’s canoe.
</p>
<p>A man of the Sg̣adji′goał lā′nas<a class="noteRef" id="n368.14src" href="#n368.14">14</a> then stood near them, holding a gun. Two cartridge boxes hung from his side. They
said he was a brave man. He said: “Tell me, Pebble-town people,<a class="noteRef" id="n368.15src" href="#n368.15">15</a> what did the Tlingit do to the people of your family in former times? When the Tlingit
formerly beat them every time why do you do this? I could do something to you for
your foolishness. You might be shot to pieces.” And, when he aimed his gun, he pointed
it at us. His name was Stᴀwa′t.
</p>
<p>I felt as though I had been struck in the face. He had pointed a short gun at me.
I seized then a long one, and I jumped off. I ran to him. I struck him at once with
the gun. I struck him in the neck. And when he was about to strike me I got my gun
ready for him. “Now, if you strike me, I will shoot you.” Two of my friends who were
ashore then struck him with their guns. And Natqā′g̣oñ said to him: “This is not the
first time [men of his family have done such things], and they are also brave. Why
don’t you strike back?”
</p>
<p>Then some one said to us: “Cease doing it to him. You have struck him more than enough
for his talk.” We then stopped, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb369">[<a href="#pb369">369</a>]</span>they took us over to the camping place. A part of our people went round the point.
Then Gustᴀmᴀ′lk invited us. And there they pulled in the two canoes. There were a
great number there of my father’s nephews, born in the same town with me. They set
us then in a line.
</p>
<p>And, after he had begun to give us food, the Masset people went down to the canoes
in a crowd. And, when they had nearly reached our slaves, I handed my gun to Skᴀ′ngwai’s
father. I then ran down. I made fast my knife in my hand. I then pushed them away
and anchored the canoes outside.
</p>
<p>They then began to give us food. And we had on our cartridge boxes. We also kept our
guns at our right sides, and we had our knives hanging down in front. At the same
time we ate. Then we finished, and they gave us tobacco.
</p>
<p>And in the evening those born with me and my father’s nephews gave me tobacco. Besides,
they made me an offer for one of my slaves. They offered sixty blankets for him, an
unused musket, a whole suit of clothes, two bags of shot, a big canoe, many things
of all kinds. I refused them.
</p>
<p>We remained awake that night. A part of us slept ashore. I was all covered with blood
from fighting. Very early on the next day they started in this direction. And, when
we were ready to go, Skᴀ′ngwai’s father went after some water. He was gone for a long
time. While he was still away, Gana′-i’s canoe started. The wind was in the north.
I then left the people directions what to do about him. And we left him.
</p>
<p>The Masset people afterward took him in. They landed him at Rose spit. He walked home
from there. And on that day, when it was almost evening, we sailed by in front of
Skidegate. The Skidegate people came out in a crowd to us. We did not stop.<a class="noteRef" id="n369.16src" href="#n369.16">16</a> They stood behind us [watching]. We spent that night at Water-hole.<a class="noteRef" id="n369.17src" href="#n369.17">17</a> The one in our canoe whom they had wounded was still alive.
</p>
<p>And we started off from there at night. Then we made a camp fire on the inlet above
Tcꜝā′ał.<a class="noteRef" id="n369.18src" href="#n369.18">18</a> From there we started very early to Qa-itg̣a′og̣ao. At that time we sang a war song.
</p>
<p>We then went into Qa-itg̣a′og̣ao, singing songs of victory. Hu hu hu hu. When we were
going up to the houses we landed the slaves. Some of them carried children. After
having fought we sang songs of victory for many nights.
</p>
<p>Here is all of this story.
</p>
<p id="ch3.40.n" class="small">This and the following eight stories and that on page 104 practically constitute one
long account of the Haida wars, or rather raids, which have taken place within recent
times, except only those related by Abraham of Kloo, which succeed. The story-teller
was an interesting old man who, as will be seen by the texts, had himself taken part
in many of these expeditions and had lived a life full of adventure. He belonged <span class="pageNum" id="pb370">[<a href="#pb370">370</a>]</span>to the Middle-gîtî′ns (Ya′ku-gitina′-i), a branch of the Pebble-town Gîtî′ns of the
west coast, but, while still a young man, had gone to live with members of his family
in Alaska. After that he and his uncle were in the employ of the Hudson Bay Company
for a long time, until he finally came back to Skidegate to live. He was acquainted
with some myths, but war stories were his “specialty.”

<p class="first center">[Told by Richard of the Middle-gîtî′ns]
</p>
<p>The Ninstints people<a class="noteRef" id="n371.1src" href="#n371.1">1</a> came to Kaisun in four canoes to ask us<a class="noteRef" id="n371.2src" href="#n371.2">2</a> to go to war in their company. We then went along in four canoes. And, after we had
gone across, we entered Lᴀlgī′mi.<a class="noteRef" id="n371.3src" href="#n371.3">3</a> During the night we went in opposite to a fort. Some people were then camping in
the inlet. We began to shoot at them. There Amai′kuns was killed. Gayî′ns<a class="noteRef" id="n371.4src" href="#n371.4">4</a> was wounded. Qoyā′<a class="noteRef" id="n371.5src" href="#n371.5">5</a> was also wounded. He was one of the brave men among us. There we took two slaves.
</p>
<p>We went out from there. And those who went in advance came upon some who were sailing
along. The sound of two guns was heard. Afterward an empty canoe drifted away. They
enslaved two women. And we went thither. And, while we were close to land, rejoicing
over the slaves, some persons came sailing round a point near us, and, when they saw
us, they jumped off. Then some landed behind them.
</p>
<p>I then prepared myself and got off. And I pursued one who was running along near the
sea. After I had chased him about for a while in the woods he jumped into the ocean.
I took from him his yellow cedar blanket with some of his hair. And, when he emerged
farther out, he held up his hands before my face. He then swam to me. When he came
near me he dove again. And he came to the surface out at sea. I then began to shoot
at him. And he swam landward and squeezed himself tight against the face of a cliff.
After I had shot twice at him there, I stopped. He then climbed up a tree that stood
against the face of the cliff. And, although there was some space between its top
and the cliff, he bent it over, got a hold on the face of the cliff, and went into
a hole there. He could not climb thence either down or up. We said one to another
that he would die there.
</p>
<p>We then went away. We next made a fire and began to give each other food. And after
we left we began to fight against the fort. We could not get away then. We could not
get away.<a class="noteRef" id="n371.6src" href="#n371.6">6</a> But afterward they got us back [into the canoe]. And they shot one who was crawling
about on the top of the house so that he fell down. And after they lay out to sea
for a while a man wearing a dancing skirt and cedar-bark rings dragged down a canoe.
A woman also came after him. She came to us and talked to those who were in Ldō′gwañ’s
canoe. They told her then to come closer. And some called to them to shoot the man
so that he would fall into the water. Ldō′gwañ refused to allow it and started away
from them. They then went off in fright. We ran out of ammunition. Then we went away.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb372">[<a href="#pb372">372</a>]</span></p>
<p>We then started from Point-djī′dao and, after we had spent four nights upon the open
sea, we came to G̣ᴀ′ñxet-kun.<a class="noteRef" id="n372.7src" href="#n372.7">7</a> After traveling two nights from there we came to Kaisun. We had really brought nothing
with us from the far country.
</p>
<p>This is the end of the story.

a Tsimshian tribe, but he may have been mistaken. In that case it must have been some
tribe related to the Bellabella.

<p class="first center">[Told by Richard of the Middle-gîtî′ns.]
</p>
<p>The Pebble-town people warred with the people of Ninstints. The East Coast people<a class="noteRef" id="n373.1src" href="#n373.1">1</a> were also at war with them. They were all at G̣ētgā′ñ.<a class="noteRef" id="n373.2src" href="#n373.2">2</a>
</p>
<p>From that place the father of Qꜝaolga′s went to hunt. Then they saw a war canoe pass
a place named Gia′g̣ēs lying toward the south. It came along close to the shore and
passed behind an islet. And they did not know those who were in it.
</p>
<p>And when it was far off he started straight out to sea. And, when the rocky shore
had nearly passed out of sight, he turned about. At evening they heard the sound of
his guns at G̣ētgā′ñ. He had seen the enemy. Then they went for two shamans who were
there. And they whipped the souls of the enemy. At that time they said that a white
raven flew into the inlet. After they had drunk salt water for two nights all the
warriors went out to meet the enemy.
</p>
<p>After they had crept along close to the shore for a while they feared to round ʟuqā′łgᴀłdᴀs.<a class="noteRef" id="n373.3src" href="#n373.3">3</a> So they stopped there. Some of them said that Kaisun could be seen from there. By
and by, however, they went thither. They then saw some persons walking on the beach
at Kaisun.
</p>
<p>After some time had passed the canoe came in front of them (those at Kaisun). They
got into it and went seaward. In the middle was a shaman whipping the souls of his
enemies. Then one [Ninstints man] in it saw a strange sight. “Look at the cormorant
flying about. It has no head.” And, when they looked at it, its head was lacking.
Kꜝadja′-i alone<a class="noteRef" id="n373.4src" href="#n373.4">4</a> did not see this.
</p>
<p>After they had gone on for a while a shot was fired at them. At once [the guns shooting]
downward resounded everywhere. It (the canoe) turned bottom up. And as they came alongside
they shot at them. And after they had destroyed them and had turned the canoe over
one person was in it. He alone they saved. When the first gun sounded, the war chief
said: “Sqas, take the gun away. It is not time for that.”
</p>
<p>They then went away. Now they sang war songs. And the next day they went to get the
heads. They then cut them off and dried them in the sunshine. The shaman who had whipped
the souls of his enemies had his hair bunched together.<a class="noteRef" id="n373.5src" href="#n373.5">5</a> He had told them to go back. On the way they (the Ninstints people) saw portents.
They heard the <span class="pageNum" id="pb374">[<a href="#pb374">374</a>]</span>sound of drying frames dropping from above. And Tia<a class="noteRef" id="n374.6src" href="#n374.6">6</a> also called near them. He called, and blood spurted out of his neck.

</p>
<p>They had occupied Thin-fort. There were many black cod there. Then they saw portents.
The black cod, the day after they were brought in, moved their mouths. And at one
time a headless cormorant came there.<a class="noteRef" id="n375.1src" href="#n375.1">1</a> Some time after that, they say that [the children] who had a little fire in a cave
below them and were picnicking there, ran out of it. Some small being with disheveled
hair and a yellow-cedar-bark blanket over its shoulder came out of the cave. It was
Supernatural-slave<a class="noteRef" id="n375.2src" href="#n375.2">2</a> who was among them, they say. Its belly was big, they say. Then they feared to play
in the cave.
</p>
<p>After that the rotten gills lying about groaned. Another day Tia flew over to the
fort from the opposite side. He said “Tia, tia,” and blood spurted out of his neck.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n375.1asrc" href="#n375.1">1</a>
</p>
<p>One day, while they were away fishing for black cod, they (the enemy) came upon them.
These were the Kaigani, Sta′stas, and Middle-town people. Then they shot up at the
fort. My grandmother was born among them. That was why they did not touch her people.<a class="noteRef" id="n375.3src" href="#n375.3">3</a>
</p>
<p>One man then shot from the fort. When his ammunition failed they went up to the fort.
They enslaved all of the Pebble-town people. And, going out to those who were fishing,
they destroyed half of them also. Some escaped to Kaisun.
</p>
<p>When the warriors started off they were told about a child of the Middle-gîtî′ns,<a class="noteRef" id="n375.4src" href="#n375.4">4</a> whose cousin was carrying her on her back. They would have taken her back, but were
afraid. When they had recrossed her friends adopted her.<a class="noteRef" id="n375.5src" href="#n375.5">5</a> At the end of the following autumn they brought her back.
</p>
<p>After that they sent word by canoe that they wanted to make peace. They (the West
Coast people) then went thither. When they arrived at Tꜝē<a class="noteRef" id="n375.6src" href="#n375.6">6</a> no attention was paid to them. And, since their food was gone, they wanted to buy
food from one who lived opposite. He was stingy, and they laid hold of him. Although
he was a chief they enslaved him. They also fought the people of Tꜝē. And they killed
many of them, and those they enslaved were many. The Pebble-town people made matters
even.
</p>
<p>And, after they had talked over where they should have a fort, they made one on the
west coast. Two were staying at Kꜝiū′stᴀ. After some time had passed the Kaigani people
came to make peace. When they stopped in front they began to shoot at them. When they
fled they <span class="pageNum" id="pb376">[<a href="#pb376">376</a>]</span>met the two persons<a class="noteRef" id="n376.7src" href="#n376.7">7</a> in a canoe. When they were going to enslave them they jumped into the water. And
they swam over to an islet. They now fled in terror.
</p>
<p>Some time after that they went to the Kaigani country to fight again. Then they destroyed
some people there. They enslaved ten and killed many. And, while they were on the
way back, the wind was strong, and they threw some slaves overboard. They did this
to four. The Kꜝiū′stᴀ people then came to them. And they took the slaves away from
them and split up their canoe. They then started home around by the West Coast shore.
They went to Tcꜝā′ał.<a class="noteRef" id="n376.8src" href="#n376.8">8</a> They came to Lagî′nda,<a class="noteRef" id="n376.9src" href="#n376.9">9</a> where people were catching salmon. A single slave was with them. The chief finished

<h2 class="main"><span class="sc">Wars between the Stikine and Sitka Tlingit</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Richard of the Middle-gîtî′ns]
</p>
<p>The nephew of Cēks lived at Sitka for the sake of some woman. He was killed there.
Then all the Stikine people went to Sitka to fight. At that time they had a pitched
battle there, and they destroyed many Sitka people. After that the Sitka people also
started out to war.
</p>
<p>At that time the eulachon were running into the Stikine. After they had filled the
ground with holes they went out to get stones. They did not have the right kind of
stones there. They had only whetstones. And, when they came from it, a man passed
out by them to get some. His name was Daoł.<a class="noteRef" id="n377.1src" href="#n377.1">1</a> Then he gave them the following prediction: “They will kill me [and my family] when
the tide is on the ebb, and I shall never come back.”
</p>
<p>As soon as the tide was out they went out to fight. The warriors came upon him at
the place where he was gathering stones. Then they took him into the war chief’s canoe.
He had left his gun behind. They then made fun of him by telling him to do various
things.
</p>
<p>While they were talking to him the warriors (his friends) came into the bay. They
asked him then: “One-who-is-always-mentioned, are you still alive?” “Yes,” he said.
He also asked: “Did you bring my gun? Did you bring my knife?” “Yes.” “Give them to
me.” They then got his things to him.
</p>
<p>When he put on his cartridge box some one shouted: “Ixiâ′⁺ī,<a class="noteRef" id="n377.2src" href="#n377.2">2</a> One-who-is-always-mentioned has his weapons in his hands.” Then, forgetting himself,
he shot. Straightway they all shot. And he also said that he pulled out his knife
and kept striking them as he moved forward. They then destroyed the Sitka people.
They stabbed those who there escaped to the woods. They said that two young fellows
then came from watching for their enemies. They took them into Cēks’s canoe.
</p>
<p>They then went away. On the next day they collected heads. Some of them got twelve.
Others got ten. The heads were drying in the sunshine, looking like clothes drying
on a line and bellying in the wind. Then Cēks, having called the people together,
told them to stop fighting. He told them that they had destroyed the Sitka people.
</p>
<p>By and by they let the two youths that they had enslaved go. They then ripped open
the seams in a little, old, 3-fathom canoe. In it they started off. They also gave
them a small paddle. They thought then that they would drown. In the summer after
that they heard that they had escaped.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb378">[<a href="#pb378">378</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some time afterward the Sitka people were coming to make peace. And they got ready
for them. They thought it well to make peace [they said]. Then Cēks again called the
people together, and they agreed to destroy them. They then talked over how they should
preserve themselves from injury.
</p>
<p>By and by the Sitka people came in many canoes. After they had danced for a while
in front of the town they came ashore, and the dancers entered the house and danced
there. Then property was given to them. They gave them four or two slaves apiece as
blood money. After that they also danced in Cēks’s house. When nearly all were in
they shut the door, and they killed those outside and threw their bodies over the
cliff in front.
</p>
<p>After they had killed all of those they crowded against each other near the door.
They then quietly pulled out one after another, stabbed each one, and threw out the
bodies. At that time a woman looked in through the smoke hole. She held a knife. She
made the motion of cutting off heads. She said that they were going to destroy them.
Those who were dancing paid no attention to her. After they had killed on for a while
they began to discover it for themselves. But still they kept dancing. Although only
ten were left they kept dancing. Presently they killed all. Six that they saved they
let go home.
</p>
<p>Some time afterward they began to visit back and forth. Once a great many went to
[Sitka], and Qała′x<a class="noteRef" id="n378.3src" href="#n378.3">3</a> paid a great sum to the Russians. Then many canoes came there and, when all the Stikine
people were inside the stockade, Qała′x began to fight them. And they destroyed the
Stikine people.
</p>
<p>Some time after that they became good to each other. They began visiting back and
forth again. Then ten canoes came to the Stikine, and Yaqoa′n began to kill them.
And they destroyed all of them. At that time they stopped visiting each other.
</p>
<p>Some time after that Qała′x’s nephew was in love with the daughter of a Russian. For
that the Russians killed him. They then killed the Russian’s son. They said that the
Russians were going to fight them with Qała′x, and they fortified themselves. They
built the walls out of big cedars. And they built the houses inside. They put flat
rocks along the fronts and sides of the houses.<a class="noteRef" id="n378.4src" href="#n378.4">4</a> And, after they had lived there for a while, the Iron people<a class="noteRef" id="n378.5src" href="#n378.5">5</a> came in a vessel to destroy them. After they had shot at them ten times they called
for Qała′x. When he answered they shot at him still more.
</p>
<p>After they had done this for a while they came off to fight them in three boats. All
had guns with bayonets. They came on land at once. And, after they had prepared for
them in the house, they went out. They then shot at them. While the Russians were
shooting by command they shot into them. They also threw out their cartridges quickly
and shot again. After they had done this for some time they <span class="pageNum" id="pb379">[<a href="#pb379">379</a>]</span>destroyed the Russians. Only those who had charge of the boats got to the ship. Then
the warship sailed away. [Meanwhile] they strengthened the fort.
</p>
<p>After two months had passed they came to fight them with two warships. They then shot
at them from both sides. At that time they called to him: “Qała′x, are you still alive?”
“Yes; I am not afraid of the cannon you use against me.” The cannon sounded then still
more.
</p>
<p>After some time had passed they went to get him. They then fought again with the Russians.
They also destroyed those. At that time they took guns, coats, hats, and swords. After
some time had passed, they (the Russians) brought property over to the winners. “Qała′x,
are you yet alive?” “Yes; I am still alive. I won. Now it is all right for you to
kill me.” When he said this, they raised the flags. They then gave him clothing, food,
rum, and ammunition. They let him win. Many of the Russians were killed.
</p>
<p class="small">My informant heard this story from an old Tlingit from the Stikine. It is of peculiar
interest as containing a native account of the struggle between Baranof and the Indians
at Sitka. It differs from the Russian account, however, in so many particulars that
it is evident that few real facts are preserved.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Richard of the Middle-gîtî′ns]
</p>
<p>When I was still young I knew how to handle a gun. They went then to Dadag̣ē′ni.<a class="noteRef" id="n380.1src" href="#n380.1">1</a> The Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people<a class="noteRef" id="n380.2src" href="#n380.2">2</a> fought together there. They fought while they were drinking whisky.<a class="noteRef" id="n380.3src" href="#n380.3">3</a> At that time G̣ᴀla′-i’s nose was bitten off. Then they began to fight. They shot
at each other all night, and they killed a great many there.
</p>
<p>Some time after that another fight broke out. The grandfather of Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a<a class="noteRef" id="n380.4src" href="#n380.4">4</a> then owned two slaves. He went thither with them and a gun. Although we tried to
stop them, they then went thither. They then fought there with them. They took the
ramrod from one of the slaves who then held Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a’s gun. They went then
to ask for it. He held it for payment he said. At that time they did not make a disturbance
about it.
</p>
<p>Some time afterward a vessel of the Iron people<a class="noteRef" id="n380.5src" href="#n380.5">5</a> came there. Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a then went out to it. While he was away Sitting-chieftainess
went to Brave-in-his-belly<a class="noteRef" id="n380.6src" href="#n380.6">6</a> to get the ramrod. And they who were there pushed her down. Then Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a
came ashore. The Iron people had given him all kinds of food. He brought a lot away.
There was a great quantity of all sorts of things.
</p>
<p>They did not say a word to Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a. After they got through eating I told
him. But he laughed. He called Gax̣ī′łdia-i (one of his slaves) and told him to go
out and make an announcement. Then Brave-in-his-belly also sent out to make an announcement.
And after that they killed four slaves belonging to him.<a class="noteRef" id="n380.7src" href="#n380.7">7</a> And Brave-in-his-belly owned one slave. He killed him.
</p>
<p>On the following day they gave him (Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a) a great amount of property—ten
slaves, three hundred blankets, five big canoes, a great quantity of property. At
that time he summoned the people. Slaves and property were given to the Middle-town
people,<a class="noteRef" id="n380.8src" href="#n380.8">8</a> Earth-eaters,<a class="noteRef" id="n380.9src" href="#n380.9">9</a> Dogfish-house people,<a class="noteRef" id="n380.10src" href="#n380.10">10</a> People-of-the-house-where-they-always-have-plenty-to-eat,<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n380.10asrc" href="#n380.10">10</a> Raven-house people,<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n380.10bsrc" href="#n380.10">10</a> People-of-the-house-that-went-away-discouraged.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n380.10csrc" href="#n380.10">10</a> They gave one [slave] to Unable-to-do-anything.<a class="noteRef" id="n380.11src" href="#n380.11">11</a> They gave one to Qołgî′t.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n380.11asrc" href="#n380.11">11</a> They gave one to Far-away,<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n380.11bsrc" href="#n380.11">11</a> to Qōta′n,<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n380.11csrc" href="#n380.11">11</a> to Nasta′o,<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n380.11dsrc" href="#n380.11">11</a> to Tcꜝix̣ī′.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n380.11esrc" href="#n380.11">11</a> After that they gave to all the house chiefs.
</p>
<p>On the day after that they sent for Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a, and on that day they twice called
us in. After several families had called us in the Earth-eaters invited us. They had
been giving us food for a while, when a noise arose in the direction of a canoe that
they had <span class="pageNum" id="pb381">[<a href="#pb381">381</a>]</span>given us. As soon as some one said that the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people had broken it up
the Earth-eaters went thither. They told us then that we had better not go out. We
all had guns. They told us not to go out. But still we stood together among them.
</p>
<p>Then the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people stood in lines around the edges of the canoe, holding
their guns ready. After they had quarreled for a while Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a came out,
and a boy of the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people shot at him. I, too, at once shot one. They
then shot into the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people. The dead bodies lay far apart on the ground.
Some sat up. Some tried to squirm up from their buttocks [having been shot in the
legs]. Four dead bodies belonged to the Earth-eaters. Two others they wounded.
</p>
<p>They at once began again to shoot each other. Many more of the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people
were killed. After they had given us food for a while they took us over to Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a’s
house. When they got us in the sound of fighting ceased.
</p>
<p>After that they also shot into our house. The house had three stockades. Not a single
bullet reached the house. They shot at us from around the house while we ate. Early
in the next day Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a called four families. And while they ate in the house
the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people again began to shoot at the house. And after they had done
this for a while we went down with our guns into a trench extending toward the beach.
And, while the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people were shooting into the house from near by, we
in turn shot at them. We killed two. And afterward we ran in through the doorway,
one after another. We told of those we had killed. Then the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people
went away.
</p>
<p>And when they were done eating, he gave them all coats and good clothing. Early in
the next day he called the Earth-eaters. Then they again shot at the house. They did
not reach the inside. These also went away.
</p>
<p>After that they began to shoot at our house. After they had shot at our house for
four nights Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a told us to get up very early. And, after we were done
eating, he had us wash our faces. He gave us tallow, and, when we had put it on our
faces,<a class="noteRef" id="n381.12src" href="#n381.12">12</a> we painted them. He then emptied out a big box of clothing. And as soon as we had
fitted ourselves we put it on. After that he emptied out black handkerchiefs. We tied
them around our heads. He was a great chief.
</p>
<p>After that we sang a song. After we had sung four times we went out to fight. We then
began shooting at the four houses of the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people while the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał
people drew up around us from the woods. And, after we had shot at each other for
a while, my gun became hot, and I put it into the water.
</p>
<p>Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a stood on the top of his house all of this time. He held a large horn
in his hand through which he talked to us. We <span class="pageNum" id="pb382">[<a href="#pb382">382</a>]</span>then waved something white that he could see. He knew by that that not one of us had
been killed.
</p>
<p>After we had fought for a while, and when the sun was almost set, the Middle-town
people and the Earth-eaters came to fight. They broke through the many Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał
people who were around us. They told us then to go home, and we went home. But they
fought in our places.
</p>
<p>When I came in they said that my breeches were bloody. I then felt there. The back
part of my thigh was torn. I at once became faint.
</p>
<p>Early in the next day they shot at us again. And, after they had shot at us for five
nights, Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a told us to begin fighting again. When we first fought many
of the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people were killed. There were also many wounded. And, after
we had fought for a while, and evening was come, the Middle-town people and the Earth-eaters
came and helped us. They let us go home. But they had a pitched battle in our places.
Some time after dark they stopped shooting.
</p>
<p>They shot intermittently at our house for more than a month afterward. They began
shooting at our house just before daylight. One day we did not hear a gun go off.
Then someone knocked at the door. “Open the door for me.” That was Djig̣ē′g̣as. “The
Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people are gone.” They went away very early.
</p>
<p>On the day following Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a gave property to the Earth-eaters. He gave them
eight slaves, as blood payment for the four persons that had been killed, and three
hundred and twenty blankets. Because Qołgî′t was very sorry on account of his canoe
he gave him a young slave. He was very glad to have him. And he also had his canoe
repaired. The day after he called them [to a feast].
</p>
<p>After that they again came to fight with us. Then the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people shot
at us for two nights. After they had acted toward us in this way for three months
a ship of the Iron people came. Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a then told the Iron people about himself.
Then they left us all kinds of ammunition.
</p>
<p>After fifteen nights were passed they came after Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a. And then, too,
the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people came to fight with us. After they had shot at us for two
nights they went away again. They (the Iron people) then took Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a with
them. His heart was not strong enough to go without me. So they took me as well.
</p>
<p>We then started off. Some time afterward we came to Nass inlet. Two vessels lay there.
Then they started to settle there. They put a stockade around the house, and the Nass
people brought in cedar bark. They paid a blanket for the bark of two cedars to be
used as roofing.<a class="noteRef" id="n382.13src" href="#n382.13">13</a> When the house was completed they finished the warehouse.
</p>
<p>They began at once to buy furs. All sorts of people brought furs there to sell to
them. During the whole time what was dropped upon <span class="pageNum" id="pb383">[<a href="#pb383">383</a>]</span>the ground from the tobacco that they sold I put up into a sack. When my father came
from Masset I gave it to him. And Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a gave him many blankets from the
trading house. My father gave him a canoe. In it they went to the head of Nass inlet
with property to trade. At the end of ten nights the 10-fathom canoe was full of furs.
</p>
<p>At that time Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a threw chips into the water and shot at them. One youth
then wanted the gun very much. And he asked how much it cost. They told him then that
they would let him have it if he piled up furs to the muzzle as it stood on end. They
then stood the gun on end, and they piled up beaver skins alongside it. And, when
they reached the muzzle of the gun, they pressed them down. And when [the pile] got
lower they piled on more. By and by, when it got even with the end, they stopped.
And he also bought a longer one. And he gave six land-otter skins for the ammunition.
He also gave six land-otter skins for a bag of bullets.
</p>
<p>They then went away. After five nights were passed they returned. After they had lived
there three years it was found to be too cold, and they removed to Port Simpson. There
also I lived with them seven years. Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a lived at the house of the Iron
people. After that he lived there all the time.
</p>
<p>Here is all of this.
</p>
<p class="small">This story gives us an idea of what intestine conflicts were like among people on
this part of the Northwest coast. Strife having arisen between the Tcꜝā′ał-lā′nas
and Ya′ku-qe′ig̣awa-i, or Ya′ku-gitina′-i, to which latter family my informant himself
belonged. The Raven families among the Kaigani joined the weaker, and apparently the
aggrieved, party. The feud was not ended, however, until the chief of the Ya′ku-qe′ig̣awa-i
went away to live with the white people.

<p class="first center">[Told by Richard of the Middle-gîtî′ns.]
</p>
<p>The Skidegate people went once to trade at Port Simpson<a class="noteRef" id="n384.1src" href="#n384.1">1</a> in sixty canoes. The Pebble-town people<a class="noteRef" id="n384.2src" href="#n384.2">2</a> also went there. And they traded with dry halibut. They lived outside. There a Tsimshian,
who was with a white man, came to them. Sticks were given around to them (the Haida).
And afterward he took the sticks back again. They planned to destroy them during the
winter. That was why they counted them.
</p>
<p>A woman of the <span class="corr" id="xd32e28322" title="Source: Gitî′ns’-servants">Gîtî′ns’-servants</span><a class="noteRef" id="n384.3src" href="#n384.3">3</a> named Bufflehead<a class="noteRef" id="n384.4src" href="#n384.4">4</a> sold dry halibut to the wife of Lgiäx.<a class="noteRef" id="n384.5src" href="#n384.5">5</a> She said it was too small and she wanted to exchange it for more. Bufflehead then
refused to give her more in exchange. And they threw the dry halibut at Bufflehead.
She then threw the dry halibut in the face of Lgiäx’s daughter, and she went home
crying.
</p>
<p>Some one shouted, and I went out. They were throwing stones at each other. They gave
each other a thorough stoning. By and by they stopped. And some time afterward a gun
went off. Some one shouted: “They killed so-and-so.” Some time after that another
gun went off. Another was shot. Then it stopped for a while. When evening came they
began to shoot at us. All through the night they shot at the Skidegate people. During
all that time they shouted out [the name of the person shot]. I was then without a
gun, and I borrowed one. I held it and two cartridge boxes. They shot at the sail
houses on the beach in which we lived. There was nothing behind which we could shelter
ourselves. Then I dug a hole for myself in the sand and lay in it.
</p>
<p>I then shot at some one who lay behind a log and was shooting, back from the sea.
I shot off his hat. When I shot at him again I shot his gun away from him. He then
ran away.
</p>
<p>A hill lay behind us, from which they were shooting at us. I also began to shoot at
those. They also ran away. After they had shot at us for five nights they stopped
for a while.
</p>
<p>Then the Tsimshian came to dance. They wanted to make peace because we had killed
Lgiäx’s nephew. We also enslaved two women who were walking seaward from the town.
By and by they started to dance. We then gave them some property. After this had gone
on for a while they made the following arrangements. They said that <span class="pageNum" id="pb385">[<a href="#pb385">385</a>]</span>we might go with them to Laqꜝalā′m. And we said that we would give them more property.
We thought then that it was all right, and we went to our canoes. While a part of
the provisions lay on shore the Tsimshian took the provisions. We then got into our
canoes. I pushed my canoe off with the many which were there. When the canoes got
away two remained. I then ran toward the fort at Port Simpson.<a class="noteRef" id="n385.6src" href="#n385.6">6</a> There was yet a crowd of Skidegate people there. And, while I stood there, two canoes
with the dancers<a class="noteRef" id="n385.7src" href="#n385.7">7</a> in them were still there. Then the Tsimshian pursued. They shot into the canoes,
pulled themselves close alongside, and in a short time they drifted along empty. Then,
when the two that were there started off, I ran down from in front of Port Simpson
house. I jumped into the stern. Then the two dancers<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n385.7asrc" href="#n385.7">7</a> [in their canoes] paddled backward. I took a gun and shot them both. At that time
I scared them. Those who first went off took their property. A south wind was blowing.
Canoes drifted off empty.
</p>
<p>They then shot much at us from Laqꜝalā′m. There was no gun in my canoe. After that
they again shot at us. We then fled. During all that time the Tsimshian pursued us.
That was a great disaster, though the story of it sounds well enough. They pursued
us far out to sea. I was in my wife’s canoe.
</p>
<p>When they got far out at sea they returned. They enslaved very many of the Skidegate
people.
</p>
<p>Then they (the Skidegate people) landed at ʟꜝg̣a′odana-i.<a class="noteRef" id="n385.8src" href="#n385.8">8</a> At that time a heavy rain set in. They called it “The-rain-upon-the-skins-of-dead-bodies.”
And, when daylight came, I built a big fire. Then the wounded sat around the fire.
On the following day, when we started off, a man of Those-born-at-House-point<a class="noteRef" id="n385.9src" href="#n385.9">9</a> was angry, because, he said, we went off first. Then he and I were going to shoot
each other. They held us apart. And they went away.
</p>
<p>And on the next day they stood crying in front of ʟꜝg̣a′odana-i. The Pebble-town people
did not cry, however, because all of them escaped. Fifty canoe loads were destroyed.
The weather was bad. And, while they lay there, the one who had quarreled with me
came to me and pulled up his canoe alongside of ours. He then made peace with me.
He gave me whisky. And, after we had sent food through the fire to those who had been
unable to escape, we spent the night in our canoes. We remained awake. We were afraid.
We thought that they might pursue us again.
</p>
<p>And when day broke we went away. About noon they sailed over to Skidegate. They laid
the blame on Bufflehead, who had escaped. They then asked her for property. Her husband
was named Lū′g̣ot.<a class="noteRef" id="n385.10src" href="#n385.10">10</a> Then they began to give away property. He was about to make a potlatch. His house
pole lay there for good. He gave the town all of his property.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb386">[<a href="#pb386">386</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some time afterward Gudiqā′yiñao’s father came back. They had been unable to get away
from Port Simpson house, whence they came. Before he could ask for blood money the
<span class="corr" id="xd32e28383" title="Source: Gitî′ns’s-servants">Gîtî′ns’-servants</span> came there, with paddles on their shoulders. They said that they had come to go to
war for him.
</p>
<p>Some time afterward a great many Masset people went to trade. They came to the Gyînxᴀngī′g<a class="noteRef" id="n386.11src" href="#n386.11">11</a> family. They say that there were sixty canoes. After they had been there for a while
they started off. And, after they had traded, a Tsimshian shot at the canoes. The
bullet then struck the canoe of a man of the Point-town family<a class="noteRef" id="n386.12src" href="#n386.12">12</a> named X̣ᴀ′na.
</p>
<p>His son then seized a gun and shot into a crowd standing on shore. And he shot one
down. They at once shot after them. They immediately started off. The Tsimshian chased
them. They made them upset by shooting. They also destroyed them. They took them also
for slaves. They also enslaved many of the Rotten-house people.<a class="noteRef" id="n386.13src" href="#n386.13">13</a>
</p>
<p>At that time they destroyed a canoe at Laxanē′st<a class="noteRef" id="n386.14src" href="#n386.14">14</a> out of which two men and a woman escaped. Many nights afterward, when some persons
came there for wood, they got away in their canoes. And in them they came across.
They were saved.
</p>
<p>Those in Port Simpson house who could not escape were afterward presented with a canoe
by the Iron people,<a class="noteRef" id="n386.15src" href="#n386.15">15</a> who let them escape. Those also got home. Then, too, it was not a good time.
</p>
<p>Gîtqōna′-i’s father went to Masset, and five families<a class="noteRef" id="n386.16src" href="#n386.16">16</a> banded together and began to drink sea water. During the whole time they practiced
how they would fight. A cartridge box then caught fire, and a man was burned.
</p>
<p>After they had drunk sea water for six nights they set out to war in ten canoes. And,
when they reached the mainland, some stopped at Qꜝadō′.<a class="noteRef" id="n386.17src" href="#n386.17">17</a> After they had looked for enemies on the opposite side as well, [they saw] two canoes
go out from Siwā′łins<a class="noteRef" id="n386.18src" href="#n386.18">18</a> after salmon.
</p>
<p>They then quickly pulled toward them. They shot the man in the stern, so that he fell
over into the water, after which they closed with the canoes. When they ran into them
to fight they upset them. They then even struck them in the sea. Gî′tg̣ax̣ī′lîña killed
three people at that time. The Tsimshian had killed his wife, of whom he was very
fond. Four persons were in the canoe. They also destroyed two canoe loads which were
farther off.
</p>
<p>After they had watched for a while longer [they saw] three more canoes sailing along.
They killed all the people in those. They took the heads of them all. After they had
watched for some time longer two canoes came with sockeyes. They went out also to
those people and killed them. On that day they destroyed seven canoes. On that day
they killed twenty-eight people. They enslaved one brave man of the Tsimshian.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb387">[<a href="#pb387">387</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Masset people were then happy. They went off singing songs of victory. And they
came to Masset singing songs of victory, for they had made accounts even. But the
Skidegate people did not come out even.
</p>
<p>But Gî′tg̣ax̣ī′lîña’s canoe was unfinished. When he had finished it he brought over
to his brothers-in-law at Gᴀsa′n<a class="noteRef" id="n387.19src" href="#n387.19">19</a> the news that their sister had been killed. His brothers-in-law belonged to the Sand-town
people.<a class="noteRef" id="n387.20src" href="#n387.20">20</a> When he came they, too, raised their canoes. He also went with them. The Sand-town
people went in four canoes.
</p>
<p>They then began to watch Tcꜝidᴀlqꜝeda′-i.<a class="noteRef" id="n387.21src" href="#n387.21">21</a> After they had watched for a while four Tsimshian canoes came there. They then shot
at them. They made them upset, and they enslaved six women. They killed many men.
There Gî′tg̣ax̣ī′lîña got some slaves. He gave them to his brothers-in-law. Afterward
they went home happy. They sang songs of victory as they came to Gᴀsa′n.
</p>
<p>Three days later news came to Gᴀsa′n that one of the Yä′dᴀs<a class="noteRef" id="n387.22src" href="#n387.22">22</a> had been killed at Howkan.<a class="noteRef" id="n387.23src" href="#n387.23">23</a> The Yä′dᴀs then went to Howkan to fight, and killed six people there. And afterward
the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał people also went to fight at Gᴀsa′n. There they also killed many
of the Yä′dᴀs. They then began to war upon each other. In all that time many were
killed on both sides.
</p>
<p>Some time afterward some of the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał<a class="noteRef" id="n387.24src" href="#n387.24">24</a> people went to visit one of their friends who had married in Masset. After they had
stayed there for a while and were on the way home many of them upset. A chief named
Voice-at-evening was drowned. In the winter his nephews went for his grave post. When
it was almost finished the Yä′dᴀs came there to fight and killed five of the Town-of-Tcꜝā′ał
people. The grave post lay there for good.
</p>
<p>They at once began fighting again. Wherever they met they killed one another. They
killed each other during many years. They did not make peace with one another. Some
are still bad to one another.
</p>
<p>Some time afterward news came that one of the Sqoā′ładas<a class="noteRef" id="n387.25src" href="#n387.25">25</a> had killed one of the Cod-people<a class="noteRef" id="n387.26src" href="#n387.26">26</a> at Kꜝiū′stᴀ.<a class="noteRef" id="n387.27src" href="#n387.27">27</a> He was a great chief. He had a house hole at Tꜝī′g̣ᴀn.<a class="noteRef" id="n387.28src" href="#n387.28">28</a> His nephews then killed a shaman, Tcꜝā′nūt, belonging to the Sa′gua-lā′nas.<a class="noteRef" id="n387.29src" href="#n387.29">29</a> They shot ten bullets into him. He was town chief. He owned the town of Qᴀñ. After
they had shot him and had walked around him for a while one of his bunches of matted
hair, which was lying on the ground, rose up and lay over his head. It went on in
that way until all came to lie over his head.
</p>
<p>When the Sqoā′ładas on the west coast heard that they had killed Gîtkū′<a class="noteRef" id="n387.30src" href="#n387.30">30</a> they also went to war. They killed many of the Cod-people. They also enslaved one
of them.
</p>
<p>After that one of the Sg̣adjī′gua-ał-lā′nas<a class="noteRef" id="n387.31src" href="#n387.31">31</a> in Masset, named Kiłtcꜝāñ, invited the people. And he had a dance. He pulled out
ten slaves that he owned in a string [holding each other’s hands]. After <span class="pageNum" id="pb388">[<a href="#pb388">388</a>]</span>they had taken home food one of the Middle-gîtî′ns<a class="noteRef" id="n388.32src" href="#n388.32">32</a> named Łnē′kꜝî, shot one of the Cod-people in the arm from between the houses. Upon
this his two younger brothers acted as if they were drunk. They killed there a chief,
Gā′la. He belonged to the Ya′gun-gîtîna′-i.<a class="noteRef" id="n388.33src" href="#n388.33">33</a> He did not die at once. He died afterward. His entire family shot at once at the
house of the Cod-people. They killed two persons.
</p>
<p>For ten days and nights they fought in the town. No one had a fire. No one had water.
When the chiefs’ wives, thinking that they would not touch them, went for water the
Ya′gun-gîtîna′-i smashed their buckets with stones, and they returned. At the end
of ten days the Ya′gun-gîtîna′-i suggested making peace. They then stopped shooting
at the house.
</p>
<p>By and by an old man, their uncle, came behind the town singing catastrophe songs.
He belonged to the Cod-people. After he had sung for a while he made a good speech:
“Chiefs, my brothers-in-law, the war trail and the feather trail came out together
at Na-i î′n­djawa in the middle of the town. I went up by the war trail. I came out
upon the feather trail. ‘What town is this? What town is this?’ ‘Chief, my son, this
is the town of Gā′la, your father. You started up on the war trail which comes out
in the middle of your father’s town. <span class="corr" id="xd32e28520" title="Source: You">Your</span> fathers were troubled<a class="noteRef" id="n388.34src" href="#n388.34">34</a> about you. You came out upon the feather trail.<span class="corr" id="xd32e28532" title="Not in source">’</span>” He also spake so: “Is it my father’s town? Is it indeed my father’s town? [I thought
it was] some other.”<a class="noteRef" id="n388.35src" href="#n388.35">35</a>
</p>
<p>They then started to dance. After they had been for two days in the woods, they were
called toward the house. They came then and stood in a line in front of the house.
They had their guns ready. Presently the Ya′gun-gîtîna′-i stood in lines opposite.
They struck each other with their guns. They struck each other with their knives.
</p>
<p>By and by the Cod-people picked up two chiefs [of the <span lang="hax">Ya′gun-gîtîna′-i</span>].<a class="noteRef" id="n388.36src" href="#n388.36">36</a> There was a great crowd of people. They picked them up and laid them upon a bed of
feathers in the rear part of the house. Then two slaves were tendered as blood money
to Those-born-at-Ya′gun.<a class="noteRef" id="n388.37src" href="#n388.37">37</a> And they refused them. They afterward tendered them two more. Those they refused
also.
</p>
<p>Then Tcꜝā′nut said: “Do I ask four slaves of you? My uncle is worth ten slaves and
four hundred blankets. I will not dance.” There were many in the house. They did not
pay any attention to the bad words that he gave them.<a class="noteRef" id="n388.38src" href="#n388.38">38</a>
</p>
<p>By and by the Middle-gîtî′ns began rapping on the front of the house. They presently
went in and got the dancers. They took them up. They then brought them into the house
of the Middle-gîtî′ns because they had started the trouble.<a class="noteRef" id="n388.39src" href="#n388.39">39</a> They brought these in [to give to them property]. They (the Middle-gîtî′ns) gave
them the four slaves. They also gave them a great quantity of property. They (the
Ya′gun-gîtîna′-i) began to dance in the house at once.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb389">[<a href="#pb389">389</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that time the Gîtî′ns<a class="noteRef" id="n389.40src" href="#n389.40">40</a> also gave property to them. It reached beyond their expectations. After they had
danced for four nights the Cod-people came and got them. They also gave them six slaves
as blood money. And they washed their faces and began to dance. Then the Skîtg̣a′oqao,<a class="noteRef" id="n389.41src" href="#n389.41">41</a> Middle-gîtî′ns, and Cod-people gave them more property. They gave them seven hundred
blankets.
</p>
<p>Then Tcꜝā′nut married his uncle’s wife, and they made him take his uncle’s place.
And, when he kept staying away from his wife, the Middle-gîtî′ns talked roughly to
him. After they had spoken to him for a while they told him to leave the house.
</p>
<p>But on the next day his wife had him call in his friends. He called in all of the
Eagles. After he had given them all kinds of food, and evening was come, they left
him. On the next day he called in the Ravens. After he had fed them for a while it
was evening, and they went home. On the day after that he again called in the Eagles.
After those had gone home he again called in the Ravens. When eighty boxes of grease
and berries had been used up he invited the Eagles to ten more, and they assigned
while in the house the work on his uncle’s grave post.<a class="noteRef" id="n389.42src" href="#n389.42">42</a>
</p>
<p>They went to get it. After they had been four days away they came home. My father
carved the grave post at once. It was finished. He then raised it, and the potlatch
was over. He gave away four hundred blankets, and slaves with them. They gave my father
slaves and twenty blankets for carving the grave post.
</p>
<p>After that Tcꜝā′nut quarreled with his younger brother. He asked him then why he had
not evened accounts at the time when they killed his uncle. And his younger brother
made him ashamed. On that night he shot one of the Cod-people through the smoke hole.
Again they shot each other. After two days had passed they stopped fighting. And they
gave a lot of property for [the one killed]. They made them feel good then.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Richard of the Middle-gîtî′ns]
</p>
<p>They lived together in the town of Masset. In the fall they went up the inlet to dry
salmon. They camped then on both sides of A′-în.<a class="noteRef" id="n391.1src" href="#n391.1">1</a> After they had dried salmon for a while some of the Eggs-of-Skî′tg̣ao went off in
the night to hunt hair seal.
</p>
<p>He (the leader) remained then during the night on one side of an islet. There, while
he was trying to get a chance to shoot hair seal, a gun sounded from across the point.
Then a boy who was in his canoe shouted like one who is shot. “Wa′nanî, wa′nanî; they
shot me.”
</p>
<p>One who was with him jumped off then. Then he asked: “Who did it? Who did it?” Instead
of answering, they pulled away from him, and he shot toward them in the darkness.
He shot the man in the bow, so that he fell into the water. He<a class="noteRef" id="n391.2src" href="#n391.2">2</a> then went home and told his friends.
</p>
<p>Some time after that, during the night, the child came home crying. He told his friends
what had happened. The Eggs-of-Skî′tg̣ao and the Inlet-rear-town people at once began
fighting. They shot at each other through all the fall. Their wives being between
the families (i.e., of different families), their sons got dog salmon for them.<a class="noteRef" id="n391.3src" href="#n391.3">3</a>
</p>
<p>By and by they went away. After the men of both families had got into two canoes they
fought in their canoes all the way down. But the women came behind in canoes.<a class="noteRef" id="n391.4src" href="#n391.4">4</a> And when they landed they fought each other again on land. They shot at each other
there all night. There many of the Inlet-rear-town people were killed.
</p>
<p>On the next morning they fought each other again. And, since the Eggs-of-Skî′tg̣ao
landed at White-slope<a class="noteRef" id="n391.5src" href="#n391.5">5</a> first, the Inlet-rear-town people passed by in front. At that time they began to
settle at Yan.<a class="noteRef" id="n391.6src" href="#n391.6">6</a> And they had a fort on an islet there.
</p>
<p>After that they again began to fight each other. Then many were killed on both sides.
They fought through the winter and through the summer around it. By and by, after
they had settled at Yan, one of the Eggs-of-Skî′tg̣ao went over to them. Thereupon
they stabbed him in front of the town.<a class="noteRef" id="n391.7src" href="#n391.7">7</a> Then they again went across to fight. They killed four of the Inlet-rear-town people.
</p>
<p>Some time afterward a whale floated into the inlet. They went then to get it, and
with the Inlet-rear-town people they jointly cut it up. One of the Inlet-rear-town
people was killed there with a war spear. They started at once to fight again. They
then again killed <span class="pageNum" id="pb392">[<a href="#pb392">392</a>]</span>each other. At that time all the sharpshooters among the Inlet-rear-town people were
destroyed.
</p>
<p>Some time afterward a chief of the Inlet-rear-town people destroyed a whole canoe
load of the Eggs-of-Skî′tg̣ao. The war began again at once. While they were still
trying to kill one another, when I was yet a boy, there came a great pestilence,<a class="noteRef" id="n392.8src" href="#n392.8">8</a> and, when the people on the Haida islands were being destroyed, they stopped fighting.
Then there was peace.
</p>
<p class="small">The first of these families was spoken of in “Story of the House-point families” notes;
the second was one of several divisions of the Rear-town people referred to in note
<a href="#n84.6">6</a> to “<a href="#ch2.8">Story of the Food-giving-town people</a>.” My informant’s father belonged to the Eggs-of-Skî′tg̣ao or to a related family,
hence his sympathies were rather on their side.

<p>One of the Point-town people<a class="noteRef" id="n393.1src" href="#n393.1">1</a> lived in Nass. Word came that he had been killed there. Then the Point-town people
started to war. After they had drunk sea water for a while they raised their canoes.

After they had waited there until evening they went out early in the morning. They
killed then many of the Nass people. They also took slaves. At that time Qogī′s ran
after some. He ran quickly to some women who were sitting together. He started to
bring out ten by the hair. He got only six of them out.
</p>
<p>They got then all the heads of the Niska people. They got sixteen slaves for Gia′ołins,
and they got thirteen for Skîlqē′xas. Then they occupied a fort at House-point.
</p>
<p>After some time the Niska people came to fight in five canoes. That time they began
to fight at House-point. Five of the Point-town people were killed. And one canoe
load of Niska people was destroyed. They then went away.
</p>
<p>And the Point-town people again went to war. That time they fought at Nass village.
They enslaved ten for Skîlqē′xas. They also enslaved eight for Gia′ołins. They then
returned to House-point, singing songs of victory.
</p>
<p>And while they were living at Łi′elᴀñ<a class="noteRef" id="n393.5src" href="#n393.5">5</a> the Nass people came to House-point to fight. The town of House-point was empty then,
and the Nass people burned the town. And the Nass people also seized the provision
house<a class="noteRef" id="n393.6src" href="#n393.6">6</a> of Skîlqē′xas behind the town.
</p>
<p>Then the Point-town people again went to Nass to fight. At that time they met four
canoes below the town of Lag̣ᴀ′mkꜝida.<a class="noteRef" id="n393.7src" href="#n393.7">7</a> And they destroyed three. They again took some slaves that time. They came away to
Łi′elᴀñ, singing songs of victory.
</p>
<p>After they had lived there for a while, they thought the Nass people too powerful
for them, and they moved to Masset. After they had lived there some time, the Nass
people came to Łi′elᴀñ to fight. When the Nass people came upon it very early in the
morning they found the town empty, and they burned it. And, when they saw the <span class="pageNum" id="pb394">[<a href="#pb394">394</a>]</span>smoke from Masset, the Point-town people went thither to fight. At that time they
had a pitched battle. They fought all day. Many were killed on both sides. Four of
the Up-inlet-gîtî′ns<a class="noteRef" id="n394.8src" href="#n394.8">8</a> went to fight with them. Two of them were killed.
</p>
<p>And, when they came back, the Up-inlet-gîtî′ns asked the Point-town people to pay
something for them. They gave then one slave for the two men. And the Up-inlet-gîtî′ns
went away and left the slave. That evening they killed two of the Point-town people.
The Up-inlet-gîtî′ns began at once to fight with the Point-town people. Many were
killed on each side. After they had fought all winter they talked of peace. They then
gave many slaves back and forth as blood compensation. Then there was peace.
</p>
<p>When summer came the Point-town people went to the Nass to war. After they had been
unable to find an opportunity to do any damage for some time three canoes came along,
and they pursued them. They killed all who were in them. But they were Tsimshian.
They enslaved them.
</p>
<p>On account of that the Tsimshian came to fight. Then they had a pitched battle with
the Point-town people. At that time many were killed on both sides.
</p>
<p>After that the Point-town people again went to fight. Some campers were then drying
halibut at the mouth of the Skeena. They destroyed them all. They also took many as
slaves.
</p>
<p>After that the Tsimshian again came to war. At that time they took nine women as slaves
out of four canoes in which the people had gone out to pick berries. They belonged
to many families. They also killed three men. Some escaped to the woods.
</p>
<p>Many families went at once to war together. They destroyed then many Tsimshian who
were camping out. At that time they also enslaved a great number. Then they came to
Masset, singing songs of victory. Then they did not come again to fight. When it was
summer the Tsimshian came to make peace. And, while the whole town danced together,
they gave them property. When that was over they wanted the Masset people to go across
in their turn. Those also then went over to make peace. They also gave them a great
deal of property.
</p>
<p>The news then reached the Niska that they had made peace. And they also came to dance
[without having sent word in advance]. When the Nass people landed in front of the
town they shot at them. Many of the Nass people were killed. Part escaped, and some
time afterward they came to fight. At that time many were killed on both sides.
</p>
<p>Then the Point-town people also went to fight. They came to Lag̣ᴀ′mkꜝida. That time
the Nass people won. They killed many of the Masset people. When they went to war
the next time they <span class="pageNum" id="pb395">[<a href="#pb395">395</a>]</span>killed many of the Nass people. And they killed a town chief named Sqatꜝî′n. The Nass
people were very sorry on account of him. They wept and scratched their faces. The
others returned singing songs of victory.
</p>
<p>And when they went thither to fight again the town of Lag̣ᴀ′mkꜝida was empty. They
then burned the town. They captured many boxes of grease.
</p>
<p>When they returned Skîlqē′xas summoned the people. He said that he would send feathers
to the Niska. Then some of them did not like it. And Gia′ołins also summoned the people.
He said the same thing. Then all agreed. And they took over feathers to the Tsimshian.
After that they carried them up to the Niska.
</p>
<p>Some time afterward they came in ten canoes. They then carried the dancers into all
the houses. At that time they gave them a great deal of blood money. They gave three
slaves for the chief they had killed. At that time there was not a single slave left
in Masset. They gave them all away as blood money. Then they went joyfully away. Some
were dancing; some were singing canoe songs. At that time they also left feathers.
They wanted the Masset people [to visit them].
</p>
<p>They then also went over. They gave them a great deal of blood money. They had then
a true peace with each other. The Nass people also told them to come and get boxes
of grease, and they went over to get them. They [the Niska] then settled again in
the burned town. The Nass people gave them boxes of grease.
</p>
<p>And when they came home the Point-town people again fought with the Up-inlet-gîtî′ns.
Five chiefs of the Point-town people were killed. After they had fought for a while
the Point-town people carried over two copper plates to Qꜝayā′ñ.<a class="noteRef" id="n395.9src" href="#n395.9">9</a> There they threw them into the water. Then those, too, had peace with each other.
They gave slaves back and forth as blood money. And they had women on each side marry
with the opposites, because they feared that they would be angry again. Now there
was peace.
</p>
<p>Afterward, when they had been visiting among the Tsimshian for some time, one of the
Rocky-coast-gîtî′ns<a class="noteRef" id="n395.10src" href="#n395.10">10</a> was killed among the Tsimshian. When they came to make peace on account of him they
were so easy to kill on the coast that they destroyed them. Then they brought those
[dead bodies] home also.
</p>
<p>At that time some went behind the town of Masset to keep watch. And when the Tsimshian
had almost got ashore behind Masset they shot at them. They drove the warriors away.
Then the Rocky-coast-gîtî′ns went to war. They killed many Tsimshian.
</p>
<p>Afterward, when the Tsimshian came to fight, they enslaved nine of the Masset people.
Then all the families again started to make <span class="pageNum" id="pb396">[<a href="#pb396">396</a>]</span>war on the Tsimshian. At that time they continually killed each other.
</p>
<p>At one time, when they went to war and had approached some who were living in a lonely
place, one came out on shore wearing a grizzly-bear crest. They then thought that
he was all right.<a class="noteRef" id="n396.11src" href="#n396.11">11</a> They suggested making peace. The warriors returned. And the Masset people went to
make peace. They then gave a great deal of property to the Masset people.
</p>
<p>After they had started away they shot another Tsimshian. The Tsimshian then did nothing
in return. They shot down the one who was going to take Lgiäx’s<a class="noteRef" id="n396.12src" href="#n396.12">12</a> place without his saying a word. Then he did not want his nephew to be killed for
nothing and came to make peace. That time they gave a great amount of property to
him. Then there was peace again everywhere.
</p>
<p>At that time he (Lgiäx) felt very good and went to visit the Kaigani. After they had
gone along for a while they fell into the hands of the Middle-town people, who were
going to war upon the Niska. They then shot at each other. The Gîtsqoalʼâ′tcꜝî<a class="noteRef" id="n396.13src" href="#n396.13">13</a> they completely destroyed. Nine escaped along with Lgiäx to the woods. They also
broke up five canoes. Part of the Middle-town people were also killed.
</p>
<p>After two nights had passed the Tlingit came to him. During all that time they lived
on the food which had been thrown overboard and had floated ashore. The Tlingit then
carried news about Lgiäx [to his people]. And the Tsimshian went to get him in four
canoes. Then he said that he was too great to be taken away. “Do you come after me
because you think that our grandfathers ever got into strange canoes? Lgiäx does not
get into a stranger’s canoe.”<a class="noteRef" id="n396.14src" href="#n396.14">14</a>
</p>
<p>He then sent word to have food brought to himself. And, after they had started away,
they made a 6-fathom canoe. When it was finished he came to his town. Then the house
chiefs came and danced before him.
</p>
<p>Some time after they prepared for war. They set out. At that time the Tsimshian destroyed
the fort of Sidī′kun.<a class="noteRef" id="n396.15src" href="#n396.15">15</a> They enslaved many of the Middle-town people. They killed then many of the renowned
men of the Middle-town people.
</p>
<p>The Middle-town people began at once to eat medicine, and did so all winter. When
summer came they went to war. At that time they killed or enslaved many Tsimshian.
They went up directly [among the Tlingit] to sell them. They got a lot of ammunition
and guns in exchange. Then they again fortified themselves.
</p>
<p>Some time afterward the Tsimshian came against the fort. At that time the Middle-town
people went out in their canoes. They shot at each other on the ocean. Only five of
the Middle-town people were killed then. But many of the Tsimshian were killed.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb397">[<a href="#pb397">397</a>]</span></p>
<p>And, after the Tsimshian had started off, they said that they would raise their canoes.
On the very next day after they had raised them they went to fight. They enslaved
then very many women who were out after berries. At that time they came to the fort
singing songs of victory. They remained there then on the watch.
</p>
<p>By <span class="corr" id="xd32e28770" title="Source: an">and</span> by the Tsimshian came to fight again. And again many were killed on both sides. Some
time afterward they settled at Kꜝᴀgā′ni.
</p>
<p>And, after they had lived there for a while, a 3-sail canoe came. The Middle people
were going to destroy it then because a man of the Eagle side who lived with them
had gone to Masset and had been killed there. One of the Middle-town people then came
out to talk to the Middle-born.<a class="noteRef" id="n397.16src" href="#n397.16">16</a>
</p>
<p>After it (the canoe) had approached the town for a while, the Middle-born got ready
for it. And when the canoe came in front they upset it by shooting. The Middle-town
people and the Middle people at once had a pitched battle outside. Some of the Salᴀ′ndas<a class="noteRef" id="n397.17src" href="#n397.17">17</a> who were neutral went to look at the canoe. Under it they found the owner of the
canoe and his wife.
</p>
<p>After they had fought and killed each other for a while they said that Gî′tg̣ax̣ī′liña<a class="noteRef" id="n397.18src" href="#n397.18">18</a> was killed. He was kept under some slaves, but still he was killed. Many also were
wounded. When they told his grandfather, he said: “Be careful how you tell me that
Gî′tg̣ax̣ī′liña is killed.” He thought he was too great to be killed. He went then
to see him sitting up. Then he turned around quickly. There was a high cliff there.
He was going to throw himself over, when they seized him. Afterward, as he went crying
around the fire, he dashed himself against a [white man’s] anvil.
</p>
<p>Gî′tg̣ax̣ī′liña’s elder brother, Î′ldjiwas,<a class="noteRef" id="n397.19src" href="#n397.19">19</a> was sitting at the time in front of his younger brother. They then stopped shooting
one another. And Gî′tg̣ax̣ī′liña’s parents got ten slaves from the house of the Middle-town
people. Then Î′ldjiwas asked the Middle-town people to stay awake with [the body of]
Gî′tg̣ax̣ī′liña. Although they had just shot at each other, they were called for it.
</p>
<p>Then they came in a crowd. They were afraid to enter. By and by they came in. They
let them stay awake there. They were ten nights in the house. All the time they gave
them food. And, after they buried him, they gave property to the Middle-town people
to pay for the wake. After that Î′ldjiwas started to kill the Middle-town people.<a class="noteRef" id="n397.20src" href="#n397.20">20</a> Each time much property was given as blood money.
</p>
<p>By and by Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a went off on a vessel. After that, when a vessel came with
him and they went out to trade, Gîtkudja′os approached Î′ldjiwas to kill him. Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a
said to him: “Take care, they are coming to kill you.” At that time Î′ldjiwas shot
Gîtkudja′os alongside the vessel, so that he fell into the water. <span class="pageNum" id="pb398">[<a href="#pb398">398</a>]</span>The crowd of people who were about then fled to their homes. When all had got in he
went home. They then shot at him. He escaped into his house.
</p>
<p>The Middle-town people and the Middle people at once fought together. Then they again
gave a great deal of property to each other. Some time afterward a vessel again stopped
there with Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a on board. He then remained there. After they had drunk
whisky<a class="noteRef" id="n398.21src" href="#n398.21">21</a> one of the Middle-town people shot at Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a, but his gun missed fire.
He, however, killed the Middle-town man. They fought again at once.
</p>
<p>After peace had been made the father of Î′ldjiwas bought a pistol for him which was
all silver. And, when he had it in his hand in front of the town, his father’s younger
brother asked to look at it. At that time he told him that people could not be killed
by it [but only wounded]. So he shot his father’s younger brother with it. And they
again began fighting.
</p>
<p>After that they also killed Î′ldjiwas. They wounded him. After he had remained alive
for fifteen nights he held his gun loaded and said: “Now, they are coming down for
me.” He then shot through the smoke hole. And he talked again. “I am going up, and
I will throw down the planks that are inside his house. I will also throw down his
burning coals.” Then he said: “Now, I am going up to be with him.” After he had finished
speaking he was as those who go to sleep.
</p>
<p>And, when evening was coming on, something made a slight noise in the air. Then something
red fell out of the sky. It happened as he had said.<a class="noteRef" id="n398.22src" href="#n398.22">22</a>
</p>
<p>Afterward Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a killed one of the Middle-town people, and they again had
a fight. They again made peace with each other after one of the nephews of Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a
was killed. After they had given property to him, Nᴀñ-gut-tcî′ng̣a went away and settled
among the Tsimshian. His nephews lived at Kꜝᴀgā′ni.
</p>
<p>At that time a youth, Sg̣ā′gia, lived with Sg̣atcꜝîdā′łgîñ, who took care of him.
Then he treated Sg̣ā′gia badly. Getting angry with him, he drew blood. And two nights
afterward he killed Sg̣atcꜝîdā′łgîñ. He then took his three slaves. When he was going
to kill his wife also she used good words to him. He went away in his canoe.
</p>
<p>He then passed right by in front of Kꜝᴀgā′ni. He crossed the sea. He went to Tcꜝā′ał.<a class="noteRef" id="n398.23src" href="#n398.23">23</a> Sg̣ā′gia’s gun was heard to sound at Kaisun<a class="noteRef" id="n398.24src" href="#n398.24">24</a> as he came along. And, when he landed and stood among them, he related his adventure.
</p>
<p>All that summer, while they were fishing for black cod, he kept a watch for war people.
After they had caught salmon, they moved to Skidegate inlet.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb399">[<a href="#pb399">399</a>]</span></p>
<p>When we camped for the night [we heard] a Tsimshian named Xagu′n of the Gîtgwî′lgiaodjî,<a class="noteRef" id="n399.25src" href="#n399.25">25</a> who had enslaved some Pebble-people, sing songs of victory in front of us.
</p>
<p>Some who were returning home from Skidegate were enslaved by the Tsimshian. We then
carried the news to Skidegate. At that time we started to live at Xā′na.<a class="noteRef" id="n399.26src" href="#n399.26">26</a> They then asked property of us on account of what we had done to the Tsimshian.<a class="noteRef" id="n399.27src" href="#n399.27">27</a> After that, when we were living at Kaisun, more news came. They said that some canoes
had been destroyed in Skidegate passage. Part of the people were enslaved also. It
happened to three families. They did it to the Gîtî′ns’-servants,<a class="noteRef" id="n399.28src" href="#n399.28">28</a> Those-born-at-Stasa′os,<a class="noteRef" id="n399.29src" href="#n399.29">29</a> and Those-born-at-Pebble-town.<a class="noteRef" id="n399.30src" href="#n399.30">30</a> The Tlingit were the ones who did it. When we came to Xā′na Those-born-at-House-point<a class="noteRef" id="n399.31src" href="#n399.31">31</a> asked property of us for some who had been captured. Then they first gave us property.
After that we also gave them property. When we came to Tcꜝā′ał Those-born-at-Stasa′os
also asked blood money of us. We also gave to them blood money.
</p>
<p>After that the Ninstints people invited the people of Kaisun. The Kaisun people went
thither at once. And, after they had been there for a while, they went after house
planks. The Ninstints people went out also to fish near by. Some time afterward they
discovered enemies. The Bellabella<a class="noteRef" id="n399.32src" href="#n399.32">32</a> destroyed or enslaved those who were out fishing. At that time the Bellabella killed
many of the Ninstints people. They also enslaved many of the Sand-town people<a class="noteRef" id="n399.33src" href="#n399.33">33</a> of high rank. Then they at once stopped getting the parts of the house. Things went
badly. We went away immediately.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsgo]
</p>
<p>They were encamped in G̣a′ogîts<a class="noteRef" id="n401.1src" href="#n401.1">1</a> to gather fish eggs. Those-born-at-Qā′gials and Those-born-at-Skedans lived on opposite
sides.
</p>
<p>Once Koa′gians<a class="noteRef" id="n401.2src" href="#n401.2">2</a> won from Kusʟxa′s a large knife that his dead father had owned. And he refused to
give it to him. They wrangled then with each other. Then Koa′gians went out and announced
the day that they had agreed upon for fighting. On the appointed day they put on their
armor. They used helmets, war coats, and gorgets.
</p>
<p>Then Koa′gians asked: “Whom shall I use for my fighting skirt?”<a class="noteRef" id="n401.3src" href="#n401.3">3</a> And Sounding-property said: “You shall use me for your fighting skirt.” He was a
youth. They even broke up their canoes to use the pieces as gorgets.
</p>
<p>Presently, when they were ready, they approached each other in lines. Koa′gians acted
as leader of Those-born-at-Skedans. Sounding-property protected him below his breast.
And Qagi′t acted as leader of Those-born-at-Qā′gials. He, too, was a brave man, and
he determined to fight with Koa′gians. As soon as they were all engaged in battle,
Qagi′t speared Koa′gians, so that he fell. Then Qagi′t pulled him toward himself and
stabbed him with a knife. Sounding-property also lay dead in front of him.
</p>
<p>And, after they had fought for a while, Those-born-at-Skedans and the Town-of-Djī′gua<a class="noteRef" id="n401.4src" href="#n401.4">4</a> people were driven back. And they did not go near the place where they used to live.
They went instead toward the woods. And Those-born-at-Qā′gials pursued them.
</p>
<p>Then the great chief South-east<a class="noteRef" id="n401.5src" href="#n401.5">5</a> rested on two strong youths, and they helped him up the mountain. And he heard the
Skedans people calling from behind: “They are taking your beaver.” But still he went
away. South-east owned a beaver dish. That was what they meant when they called to
him.<a class="noteRef" id="n401.6src" href="#n401.6">6</a>
</p>
<p>While they carried him along he repeated: “My beaver.” And when they reached the top
of the mountain all the men and women sat with him, and he began to weep for his beaver:
</p>
<p>“<span lang="hax">𝄆&nbsp;𝄆&nbsp;Hī-ī-ī-ī-ī-ī⁺&nbsp;𝄇 𝄆&nbsp;Wadīkâ′lᴀm tcâlī′-ī-ī-ī-ī&nbsp;𝄇<a class="noteRef" id="n401.7src" href="#n401.7">7</a> hī-ī-ī-ī⁺&nbsp;𝄇 hī-ī-ī-ī⁺, hī hī hī.</span>” They then started away from there. And they came to Dju-î′tga.<a class="noteRef" id="n401.8src" href="#n401.8">8</a> And, when he saw the inlet open out, he sang another song:
</p>
<p>“<span lang="hax">𝄆&nbsp;Wâ yī′a hē ē ī ē&nbsp;𝄇</span> I look upon it, <span lang="hax">xē ē ē ē</span>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb402">[<a href="#pb402">402</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd32e28967" title="Not in source">“</span><span lang="hax">𝄆&nbsp;Wīya hī yē hē yē&nbsp;𝄇</span> There is now daylight (i.e., the trouble is partly over).<a class="noteRef" id="n402.9src" href="#n402.9">9</a>
</p>
<p>“<span lang="hax">𝄆&nbsp;Wayī′a hē′ē ē ē&nbsp;𝄇</span>”
</p>
<p>And after that they occupied Mountain-fort.<a class="noteRef" id="n402.10src" href="#n402.10">10</a> Then the women of Those-born-at-Skedans gathered a supernatural medicine. And, after
they had collected it, they gave it to One-going-to-be-the-elder-Sqaa′n.<a class="noteRef" id="n402.11src" href="#n402.11">11</a> They put it then upon a charmed necklace, and they also put some upon a looking-glass.
One-going-to-be-the-elder Sqaa′n then sent the charm over to Wā′nᴀg̣ᴀn.<a class="noteRef" id="n402.12src" href="#n402.12">12</a> And she sent over to Tcinxā′da<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n402.12asrc" href="#n402.12">12</a> the mirror on which she had put the medicine.
</p>
<p>As soon as they reached Skedans Wā′nᴀg̣ᴀn wore the charm and Tcinxā′da looked at himself
in the mirror. They felt [the effects of] the medicine at once. Tcinxā′da’s face,
which had been touched by a war spear’s point, had not healed. They went from Skedans
at once to get wives. And a large number went along.
</p>
<p>When they got near Mountain-fort they stood up. And they began to sing: “One will
not even feel where he fell, ā′hiya.”<a class="noteRef" id="n402.13src" href="#n402.13">13</a> Then someone in the canoe repeated: “That is the way it will happen.”<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n402.13asrc" href="#n402.13">13</a>
</p>
<p>At that time Qꜝayū′s got ready for them. He said that they might get off the canoe,
but perhaps he would not let them in. When they had gone ashore they entered the house.
When [Those-born-at-Skedans] acted in an unfriendly manner, as if they were ready
to do something, all escaped to their canoe.
</p>
<p>And, after they had gone up the inlet some distance, they came to their brother-in-law.
And he asked: “Say! brothers-in-law, why did you come up here?” And they said to him:
“They almost destroyed us. We escaped by sea.” Then he said: “Come back then. I think
they did it to you because I was away.” Then they returned with him.
</p>
<p>When they fought at G̣a′ogîts they had killed his nephew. He called upon his brothers-in-law
to go back because his mind was sick on account of it. So, after they landed at the
fort, they killed them. They afterward made peace with each other. After that they
ceased to treat each other badly.
</p>
<p class="small">The first of these families was the principal family at Skedans; the second, the ruling
family at Kloo. The one was Raven; the other, Eagle. They were so closely connected
by intermarriages that quarrels seldom arose between them, and the one narrated here
seems to have been thought remarkable for that reason.

<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o]
</p>
<p>Sg̣agᴀ′ño<a class="noteRef" id="n404.1src" href="#n404.1">1</a> went from Tcꜝā′ał to visit Always-ready.<a class="noteRef" id="n404.2src" href="#n404.2">2</a> After they had gone along for a while on the sqā′djañ<a class="noteRef" id="n404.3src" href="#n404.3">3</a> they came to Songs-of-victory town.<a class="noteRef" id="n404.4src" href="#n404.4">4</a> And, when they came near the shore, Always-ready shot an arrow into the canoe. When
he turned away he said: “Mine strikes in the way that it does when something is killed.”
And Sg̣agᴀ′ño paddled back behind Fin island. Then they took things out of a box for
the one who had been shot and put him in its place. And they fastened a rope around
the box and came to the town again.
</p>
<p>They then landed, and the town people carried up the things. With the rest of the
property they brought up a big, heavy box. And, after food had been given to them
to eat and evening was come, Sg̣agᴀ′ño’s companions went to a flat rock lying in front
of the town and sat there. Then Sg̣agᴀ′ño, with two youths, went toward the upper
end of the town.
</p>
<p>They (the town people) then untied the heavy box. A dead man lay in it. Then all of
the town people reached for their war spears. They ran down to the others, who were
lying idly about, and killed all.
</p>
<p>Then the chief looked behind him. And he started into the woods with the young fellows.
At that time he shook this entire island.<a class="noteRef" id="n404.5src" href="#n404.5">5</a> On account of that they began to assume the name “Island-shaker.”
</p>
<p>Then the two youths and Sg̣agᴀ′ño went away. Many nights passed over them. By and
by they came to one who was making a canoe behind X̣i′das.<a class="noteRef" id="n404.6src" href="#n404.6">6</a> The youths wished to kill him. While they were talking Sg̣agᴀ′ño came to him. When
he (the stranger) saw him he said: “Alas! he must have been doing as he always does.”<a class="noteRef" id="n404.7src" href="#n404.7">7</a> Then, without even putting away his tools, he went down before them. The man was
a good canoe-builder, and he was a good bear-hunter. He then went in and spread out
three bear skins for them, and his wife cooked food. And, when he had it set before
him, Sg̣agᴀ′ño said: “Stranger,<a class="noteRef" id="n404.8src" href="#n404.8">8</a> I shall not eat this food. This ground might see me.”<a class="noteRef" id="n404.9src" href="#n404.9">9</a> Only the youths ate the food. He then let them go in a new 5-fathom canoe.
</p>
<p>He gave them mat sails, paddles, and mats and food for the youths. Then Sg̣agᴀ′ño
said to the man: “You had better not stay where the people of Sqā′ma-qꜝe-u<a class="noteRef" id="n404.10src" href="#n404.10">10</a> camp this summer. Stay near some sandy beach. When we return from fighting we will
put off in front of you your friends who have been taken as slaves.” He then went
to Tcꜝā′ał with the youths.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb405">[<a href="#pb405">405</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Ninstints people began to live in a fort on the top of Sqas. But, although
they were afraid, the one who gave his canoe to Sg̣agᴀ′ño lived toward the sea at
Ga′-igᴀn-kun.<a class="noteRef" id="n405.11src" href="#n405.11">11</a> Then the people of Tcꜝā′ał went to war in successive parties. And they were on the
water in front of the fort.
</p>
<p>Always-ready then came out of the smoke hole, and he walked about on the roof wearing
his armor. They shot at him then with arrows. They did not pierce him. He then went
back and shot at them in turn. The next time they went to war they climbed up to the
top of the cliff. They tried to roll down stones upon them. These did not come near
the houses. The stones all skipped over the houses. And they again went home.
</p>
<p>And, after they had held them besieged for a while, they were straitened for food.
Then Always-ready told his brother-in-law to make ten bows for himself. And, after
he had worked upon them for a while, he finished them. Fine feathers were fastened
near the tips. And his brother-in-law gave them to him. He was glad to have them.
Then he gave up the big cedar bow he always used in favor of these new ones.
</p>
<p>The people of the town began to dislike him. His sisters and his brothers-in-law were
affected with the same feeling, because, on account of him, they were always hungry.
</p>
<p>One day his <span class="corr" id="xd32e29068" title="Source: brothers-in law">brothers-in-law</span> came in from fishing. His sister gave him the white part of the belly of the halibut
they had caught. On account of that he went out fishing with three persons. He took
his ten bows with him, and he took his two arrow boxes. But he left his cedar bow
behind.
</p>
<p>And on the day after he went fishing, very early, they again came to fight. And, as
he used to do, one came out on the top of the house and said “Ha-ha.” And when they
shot up at him he went in. When they again shot down from the fort, one of the floating
arrows stood on end in the water. They brought it in. From it hung a small stone.
Then they handed it to an old man among them, and, after he had thought about it for
a while, he said they did that as a sign that he (Always-ready) was out fishing. The
ten canoes then started seaward.
</p>
<p>Five went out on each side of Xē′na.<a class="noteRef" id="n405.12src" href="#n405.12">12</a> They looked for him as they went along, and, when they had nearly met at the end,
they saw him lying out to sea. Then they went to him. When he discovered them he walked
about in the middle of the canoe awaiting them. And when they got near him he took
one bow. He broke it. He took another. He also broke that. When he had done that for
a while he broke all ten bows. His brother-in-law who had made his bows for him had
notched the rounded side of the bow under the feathers. All broke just there.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb406">[<a href="#pb406">406</a>]</span></p>
<p>He then threw the broken pieces of the bows and the two arrow boxes into the sea.
He did not scratch anyone’s skin. They were afraid of him. When he threw his arrows
away they went to him. And they killed the three who were fishing with him, but him
they captured.
</p>
<p>He then got into Sg̣agᴀ′ño’s canoe. They felt too glad to know that they had taken
him. Their minds were very good on account of him. After they had gone along with
him for a while they encamped at a long sandy beach which is called G̣ᴀ′nʟ̣ī.<a class="noteRef" id="n406.13src" href="#n406.13">13</a> They there set him ashore. They sat around him on the beach. They had heard that
he was brave, so they wanted to see him.
</p>
<p>And, after they had looked at him for a while, they wanted to see how well he could
shoot. They then stood up a stick on the beach, and Sg̣agᴀ′ño had something white
hung upon it. They then gave him a bow and arrows. He did not like the arrows. They
handed him then one with an iron point. And, when he had set the arrow on the bow,
he turned around quickly to where Sg̣agᴀ′ño’s nephew sat behind him and shot him.
He fell backward from the box on which <span class="corr" id="xd32e29086" title="Not in source">he </span>was sitting.
</p>
<p>They bound him then and brought wood. And they built a large fire upon the beach for
him. They then laid him down with his back to the fire. And, while the skin of his
back was blistering from the heat of the fire, they picked up live coals and rubbed
them upon his back. They asked him: “Always-ready, does it hurt you?” And he answered:
“Ha-i, no. The one whom I killed just now hurts you. He went up before me. I shall
go up after him.<span class="corr" id="xd32e29090" title="Not in source">”</span><a class="noteRef" id="n406.14src" href="#n406.14">14</a>
</p>
<p>He was then burned to death, and they looked at his entrails. One lobe of his liver
(?) was short. That was why he was brave. They laid him then just back of the place
where they were, at the edge of the grass.<a class="noteRef" id="n406.15src" href="#n406.15">15</a>
</p>
<p>He was gone from among the families. The trouble then stopped. And they also put the
chief’s son into a box and started sorrowfully away.
</p>
<p>When he (Sg̣agᴀ′ño) ran into the woods at Songs-of-victory town, and after he reached
Tcꜝā′ał, a woman of the family composed a crying song for him:
</p>
<p>“Grandfather (i.e., Raven) shook the supernatural beings when he moved grandly.”<a class="noteRef" id="n406.16src" href="#n406.16">16</a>
</p>
<p class="small">The first of these families was the noted Raven family that owned Tcꜝā′ał, on the
west coast of Moresby island; the latter, one of the most noted Raven families among
the people in the Ninstints territory.

<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham <span class="corr" id="xd32e29116" title="Not in source">of </span>Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsgo]
</p>
<p>When they (the Kloo people) lived at People’s-fort<a class="noteRef" id="n408.1src" href="#n408.1">1</a> South-east<a class="noteRef" id="n408.2src" href="#n408.2">2</a> had two wives. One was a woman of the Sand-town people,<a class="noteRef" id="n408.3src" href="#n408.3">3</a> and one was a woman of the Pebble-town people.<a class="noteRef" id="n408.4src" href="#n408.4">4</a> He loved the Ninstints woman, because she was pretty. For that reason the Pebble-town
woman wanted her to do something wrong.
</p>
<p>Then she began helping her to do it and told her husband that she was receiving a
man of the Town-of-Djī′gua people.<a class="noteRef" id="n408.5src" href="#n408.5">5</a> He then took her outside naked and whipped her. The-elder-Sqaa′n<a class="noteRef" id="n408.6src" href="#n408.6">6</a> loved her. And she said of the Pebble-town woman, too: “I know also about her lover.”
Then South-east heard it, and he began whipping her also.
</p>
<p>The next day both had disappeared. They did not know then whither the two women had
gone. The news reached Tcꜝā′ał.<a class="noteRef" id="n408.7src" href="#n408.7">7</a> News also reached the other mother in the Ninstints country. One morning both mothers
appeared together in front of People’s-fort. Both sang crying songs for their daughters.
The Pebble-town woman and the Sand-town woman both sang one [as follows]:
</p>
<p>“On account of this my child moved about. On account of this, when my child moved
about, they ought to have heard the thunder, when my child moved about on the way
home.”<a class="noteRef" id="n408.8src" href="#n408.8">8</a>
</p>
<p>He then let them come into the fort, and he gave them blood compensation. He gave
a slave to each of them, and he also gave a great deal of property to each of them.
Then the canoes parted. The women went away satisfied.
</p>
<p>When it was near summer he went to ask in marriage the younger sister of the Sand-town
woman whom he had married. And he came to Many-chiefs at Sqā′djigît·awa′-i. And, after
he had stayed a while with his brother-in-law, he went away.
</p>
<p>Before he had gone far the mother of Many-chiefs said to him: “Many-chiefs, are you
a man?”<a class="noteRef" id="n408.9src" href="#n408.9">9</a> He then became angry and took his gun and his paddle. Then they pursued South-east.
And while they pursued him Many-chiefs was left behind. He did not have enough canoe
men.
</p>
<p>Then South-east got off. As he fled into the woods he stepped under a fallen tree,
a small limb scratched his forehead, and a small stream of blood flowed out down over
his cheeks. Then the Ninstints people all came to him. They encircled him. They waited
for Many-chiefs.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb409">[<a href="#pb409">409</a>]</span></p>
<p>One who was out of his senses said: “Why do you let him sit there? Even for the blood
that is running down his face you will be in a predicament.”<a class="noteRef" id="n409.10src" href="#n409.10">10</a> He then shot him. The name of him who shot him was Skᴀ′ndal. And they did not kill
those who were with him. Those they let go.
</p>
<p>Half of the Town-of-Djī′gua people were at Łtā′na. The news had not yet reached them.
And there there lived a man of Those-born-in-the-Ninstints-country<a class="noteRef" id="n409.11src" href="#n409.11">11</a> who was unmarried. He had just won in gambling three sea-otter skins owned by a man
of the Town-of-Djī′gua people. His (the latter’s) name was Alder.
</p>
<p>Then he (Alder) went out on Sg̣aalū′tꜝx̣ᴀs and ate medicine. There he spent the night
with the medicine on his stomach. He came home the next day, and the day after that
he began eating and drinking. His sister, West-coast-clouds, gave him birds’ eggs
to eat.
</p>
<p>He had just picked up one and was shelling it when some one came crying from a point
at the end of the town. He then laid the egg down directly and stopped all of them,
for they had started the cry.
</p>
<p>Then Alder, with his younger brother, went out to a ship [to which the Ninstints man
had gone].<a class="noteRef" id="n409.12src" href="#n409.12">12</a> And he said to his younger brother: “I will kill him even if he has gone up on deck.”
He was still on the water below, and he held his canoe against it on the starboard
side.
</p>
<p>They then went thither. They looked at him (Alder) while he was still far away, and
they asked them: “Why are they weeping on shore?” Then he replied: “I do not know.
After we got away from land, they wailed behind us. They mentioned something about
a child falling into the water.” He deceived him in that way. And the Ninstints man
was yet below them on the water, and he put the canoe alongside of his. His sea otters
lay behind where he was sitting.
</p>
<p>After he had remained beside him for a while he stabbed him. And he said: “The chief
has been killed. They are bringing home his body.” He then took back his four sea-otter
skins.
</p>
<p>And, as soon as he had killed the Ninstints man, he went at once to Strait-where-no-waves-come-ashore.<a class="noteRef" id="n409.13src" href="#n409.13">13</a> He went for gunpowder and bullets which South-east had stored behind it. He also
brought the news to Strait-where-no-waves-come-ashore.
</p>
<p>Then Ginᴀ′skilas<a class="noteRef" id="n409.14src" href="#n409.14">14</a> set a Sand-town woman outside to kill her. And Alder stopped him. “Do not do that,
chief, my nephew. You are of the same skin dirt.”<a class="noteRef" id="n409.15src" href="#n409.15">15</a> And he let her in.
</p>
<p>He then went over to the storehouse, crossing to it on a trail. When he came out there
Ninstints people were going away. And, when he came down on the shore and stood opposite
them, they said to him: “Alder, do you not see that your leg has been cut off?<a class="noteRef" id="n409.16src" href="#n409.16">16</a> I wonder what you are going to use as weapons.” And he replied: “Yes, you have cut
off my leg. I shall not have a single thing as a <span class="pageNum" id="pb410">[<a href="#pb410">410</a>]</span>weapon. Yet two nights from now I shall have procured weapons by selling you as slaves.”
</p>
<p>He then went away by canoe. He started at once with his younger brothers toward the
south. And they concealed their canoe some distance down the inlet from the fort.
They then went up into the woods. After they had gone along for a while Alder led
them across a point covered with trees.
</p>
<p>After he had gone inland he came to a storehouse. And, having thrown aside some skins
and hides<a class="noteRef" id="n410.17src" href="#n410.17">17</a> stored there, [he came to] a box of sea-otter tails that was among them. They afterward
went away.
</p>
<p>They started to watch by the fresh water opposite the fort. When the tide rose high
some people came singing from the fort. There were three young women and a man of
goodly size.
</p>
<p>They then began to shoot at them. They killed the man and one woman and enslaved the
two others, and they went off in their canoe.
</p>
<p>From the fort they heard his gun go off. They were in canoes in lines, awaiting him.
He then went into the midst [of them]. And, when he came near, they moved apart for
him. He passed through. He sang a fleeing song:<a class="noteRef" id="n410.18src" href="#n410.18">18</a> “Wahō-ō-ō hē-ōōō wahō-ō-ō hē-ō-ō-ō⁺.”
</p>
<p>And after he had fled for a time one of the Ninstints men held his hand toward him
with fingers outspread.<a class="noteRef" id="n410.19src" href="#n410.19">19</a> And he said: “I wonder to what place of safety Alder is paddling.” Then he answered:
“Slave, Hemlock-bark-scraping-knife, chase me as fast as you can. Kill me as soon
as you can.”
</p>
<p>And, when they came up to the place where they had killed the chief, they talked one
to another. They became frightened. “He is leading us to enemies near by; he is leading
us to enemies.” They then went back away from him. And he easily escaped them.
</p>
<p>He reached home and set ashore the two slaves for Ginᴀ′skilas. They took the two slaves
to Skedans<a class="noteRef" id="n410.20src" href="#n410.20">20</a> to sell them, and traded them for guns and ammunition only. They gathered ammunition
for war as one collects food.
</p>
<p>Now for a long time the war went along slowly. By and by the war expedition started.
After they had paddled along for a while they came near the fort in the night. There
was no noise of talking at the fort, and they felt strange about it. And they let
morning dawn upon them opposite the fort. And when it dawned they saw that the fort
was empty, and they went to it. Nearly all of the property lay in the houses. They
then burned down the fort. They burned the houses. They had no idea why the people
had gone.
</p>
<p>And, after they had started out of the inlet, they stopped at a large bed of kelp.
All made themselves fast to the kelp with their paddles. Then Qꜝā′siêk<a class="noteRef" id="n410.21src" href="#n410.21">21</a> began to perform in a canoe as a shaman does. After he had performed for a while
he began to whip the souls of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb411">[<a href="#pb411">411</a>]</span>enemy. And when he pulled toward himself something he had seized in the air all the
kelp broke.
</p>
<p>Then all went on. After they had gone along for a while they saw smoke. And Alder
landed in front of Songs-of-victory town. He went quickly then to the other side.
When he had come to the other side he came out behind a man who was carrying along
driftwood at the end of the trail. He shot him from behind.
</p>
<p>The Ninstints people discovered their enemies at once. Many-chiefs held a new gun.
Those left to care for the canoes then came round the point. After they had anchored
their canoes one came running out from them (the Ninstints people). He had no gun.
He held a spear. “The Town-of-Djī′gua people are always like that (i.e., cowards).
Shall I stop before I get there?”
</p>
<p>They at once ran together, shooting. The Ninstints people were driven back. The first
time he fired the flintlock on Many-chiefs’ gun broke in two. Nothing could help him.
When they went back Many-chiefs was wounded. He escaped with them into the woods.
Very many Ninstints people were killed then. Not one was killed on the other side.
</p>
<p>After they had gone into the woods after them for a while they came back. Then Ginᴀ′skilas
stood in the place where they had encamped near a whale. If one had two slaves, he
gave him one. If one had three, he gave him two. If one had one, he did not give it
to him. At that time he became still more of a chief. In exchange for those slaves
he had a house built.<a class="noteRef" id="n411.22src" href="#n411.22">22</a>
</p>
<p>And, after the Ninstints people had gone along for a while in the woods, they lived
in the mountains. Their kettles and all of their property had been captured. They
steamed whale in things that they hollowed out.
</p>
<p>While they lived there, before Many-chiefs’ wound was healed, he practiced how he
was going <span class="corr" id="xd32e29287" title="Not in source">to </span>fight. He opened again his unhealed wound. He died there. They then started away and
came out opposite Red-cod island.<a class="noteRef" id="n411.23src" href="#n411.23">23</a>
</p>
<p>And those who had gone to fight went out again the next year to fight on account of
South-east. At that time they did not know where they (the Ninstints people) lived.
After they had gone along for a while they came to a reef lying out from the mouth
of a strait.
</p>
<p>There Smoke got off. When he looked seaward he dropped to the ground. He did so, because
he saw fishing canoes.
</p>
<p>On that day they had given to Kiä′nskina-i<a class="noteRef" id="n411.24src" href="#n411.24">24</a> the white part of a halibut. That was why he was out fishing. They at once went out
from Kꜝîl<a class="noteRef" id="n411.25src" href="#n411.25">25</a> toward them, and they destroyed the people. Among others they killed the chief. They
then seized Hemlock-bark-scraping-knife on the water. “Hemlock-bark-scraping-knife,
when the <span class="pageNum" id="pb412">[<a href="#pb412">412</a>]</span> chief was chased, did you not stop them?” “No,” he said. And they struck him on the
lips with the short sinker strings that they held. They killed him with them.
</p>
<p>They then skinned Kiä′nskina-i’s head, and were happy to have it,<a class="noteRef" id="n412.26src" href="#n412.26">26</a> and they returned home with it. They ceased to think about Southeast. They stopped
warring.

<h2 class="main"><span class="sc">A fight between the Xā′gi-town people and Sand-town people</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsgo]
</p>
<p>At the town of Xā′gi<a class="noteRef" id="n413.1src" href="#n413.1">1</a> a woman of the Slaves<a class="noteRef" id="n413.2src" href="#n413.2">2</a> went outside before she went to bed. She did not return. But instead of saying anything
they kept the matter in their minds. They did not know from what town people had come
to get her.
</p>
<p>Some time afterward they discovered that she had been taken by a man from the town
of G̣a′-idi<a class="noteRef" id="n413.3src" href="#n413.3">3</a> who had been in love with her. It was a man of the Sand-town people. They went then
in a large canoe to demand the property which was given when a woman deserted her
husband. And they came there at low water.
</p>
<p>When the tide was well up he (the seducer) went out and played with his wife between
the houses. He who had formerly had her as his wife was the bow man. And, when he
paddled shoreward, he said: “Shoreward! Future people shall always remember me.” He
then took a bow and two arrows and jumped off with them. And he ran up and shot his
wife. Afterward he shot the man. At that time he escaped into the canoe. They went
away and landed. The man’s mind was happy.
</p>
<p>And Wada′<a class="noteRef" id="n413.4src" href="#n413.4">4</a> thought his town was too great to have a woman taken out of it. Then she (his wife)
said to her husband: “Make it all right with property.” He would not agree. He said
they thought his town was common. By and by she told her husband to go ahead: “Make
a stir about it. My children are clear of it.”
</p>
<p>And the people of Chief-discovered’s town<a class="noteRef" id="n413.5src" href="#n413.5">5</a> said the same things to him that Wada’s wife had said. They could not stop him. He
also thought that his town was too great. By and by they announced a fight. They cleaned
their spears. They agreed upon a day on which to fight.
</p>
<p>When the day at last arrived they came around Sqas point.<a class="noteRef" id="n413.6src" href="#n413.6">6</a> One in the town shouted: “It is becoming dry [with the number of canoes].” They landed
at once at the end of the town. Then they went to the town of Xā′gi. The people of
Wada’s town stood in lines on the beach awaiting them.
</p>
<p>When they came together all the women went into the woods. After the lines had approached
each other for a while they got within a spear cast, and one from Wada’s side shouted:
“Bring on the spear-whetstones.<span class="corr" id="xd32e29353" title="Not in source">”</span><a class="noteRef" id="n413.7src" href="#n413.7">7</a> One on the other side from among Chief-discovered’s people also said: “Ho, ho, you
are not the only ones to have them.” They thought that they had called spears spear-whetstones
when they <span class="pageNum" id="pb414">[<a href="#pb414">414</a>]</span>answered. What they really intended was to call out ten persons who were reckless
and brave.
</p>
<p>As soon as they came down they began to spear the people of Chief-discovered’s town.
At the very beginning Chief-discovered fell. Wada′, however, escaped.
</p>
<p>The people of Common-town<a class="noteRef" id="n414.8src" href="#n414.8">8</a> came in front and looked on from their canoes. Only five canoes [of the Sand-town
people] escaped. He destroyed the people of Chief-discovered’s town. After they had
pulled the spears out of the slain they (the people of Common-town) brought their
canoes in front of the people of Chief-discovered’s town and carried in the dead bodies.
They did not wish to fight.
</p>
<p>And the women came back. Wada’s wife, with her children, did not come back. Although
they hunted for her body they could not find it. And the others carried up their dead.
They did not, however, take up the body of Chief-discovered. The canoe was rolled
about by the waves with his body in it. He floated about in the bilge-water. They
treated his body in that way because they had lost so many friends through him.
</p>
<p class="small">These were both Ninstints families of the Raven clan. The former was named from an
islet in Skincuttle inlet, which is said to have been the first land to appear above
the waters of the flood raised by Raven’s uncle; see the story of “<a href="#ch3.1">Raven traveling</a>.” From this they claimed to be the oldest Haida family. The Sand-town people have
been referred to in “<a href="#ch2.8">Story of the Food-giving-town people</a>,” note <a href="#n70.4">4</a>.

<h2 class="main"><span class="sc">Wars between the people of Ninstints and the people of Skidegate</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsgo.]
</p>
<p>In the times before they had muskets the Skidegate people went toward the south end
of the island to fight. The entire town, including both clans, went along and presently
saw a fort on the landward side of Kî′ntcꜝuwit. It was named Standing-fort.
</p>
<p>After they had been fishing from the fort for a while something talked with a woman
who was cutting a fish. “Come, cut a little piece of fish<a class="noteRef" id="n415.1src" href="#n415.1">1</a> for me, younger sister.” They did not know what it was that spoke. This portent happened
because the fort was going to be destroyed.
</p>
<p>There was no way to climb up to the fort. They then laid a long pole up the side of
it. They used that to climb up on. Presently the Skidegate people came in a crowd
to the bottom of it. When they were ready to go up some one shouted down from it:
“Do not kill me. I belong to the Cumshewa-town people.<a class="noteRef" id="n415.2src" href="#n415.2">2</a> I am here with them only for a short time.” They called to him then to come down.
But he did not believe them and did not go down.
</p>
<p>By and by they started up the ladder. When they got halfway up the ladder they poured
whale grease down upon the ladder. They got up over it with difficulty. They killed
all the men and cut off their heads. The rest [of their bodies] they threw down from
the fort. The space around it was filled up. After they had destroyed them they enslaved
the women and children.
</p>
<p>And, when the war canoes started off, some young women and some young men who had
gone after spruce bark came out on the shore at the time of their departure. They
wished to go. They would not take them. And they went to the fort after they (the
warriors) had gone away. And, while they were still some way off from the fort they
heard a great sound of voices. And, when they arrived there, the air and blood rushing
out of the mouths of the severed heads made a great noise. At that time the Ninstints
people were destroyed.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Gᴀ′nx̣oat<a class="noteRef" id="n415.3src" href="#n415.3">3</a> and the people of his village went to war later. And after they had gone along for
a while they landed. At that time the Ninstints people were at Djig̣u′n.<a class="noteRef" id="n415.4src" href="#n415.4">4</a> And a man of the Sand-town <span class="pageNum" id="pb416">[<a href="#pb416">416</a>]</span>people<a class="noteRef" id="n416.5src" href="#n416.5">5</a> who had gone out from the town after something saw unobserved that enemies were in
a certain place. And, after he had watched them for a while, he shot one. No one was
about.
</p>
<p>He then cut off his head. With that he brought the news to the fort. His name was
Great-drum. Then the Ninstints people launched a large canoe. They did not know that
the Skidegate people were lying in wait for them on the shore near the fort. After
they had gone along for a while they shot at them. They upset the canoe.
</p>
<p>Then Tasgie′n and Gā′da-kuła′ns got ashore with ammunition. Both belonged to the Sand-town
people. They shot at the Skidegate people from behind rocks which leaned toward the
sea along the edges of the water. As soon as it was seen from the fort that they had
been upset they went to help them. Those were the Ninstints-gîtî′ns and the Sa′ki-qe′ig̣awa-i.<a class="noteRef" id="n416.6src" href="#n416.6">6</a>
</p>
<p>Then they landed. And they came behind the Skidegate people. At that time Yū′wa-i
came to Gᴀ′nx̣oat, who was taking a bath in the woods. He feared then to shoot him,
he was such a great chief. Then he finished “night-picks-up-the-village” (his daily
fast).<a class="noteRef" id="n416.7src" href="#n416.7">7</a>
</p>
<p>Laginᴀ′ñdigūdañ also tried to help his sons by shooting. Then Yū′wa-i came behind
the Skidegate people and shot one. He (the man shot) was all alone. He then cut off
his head and put a string on it, and he came out with it at the end of the lines of
Skidegate people. “Ho ho ho, ho ho ho, ho ho ho, Skidegate people, I am Yū′wa-i. I
am eating you up from behind.” And, when the Skidegate people saw the head that he
had on his back, even their sinews gave out [they were so discouraged].<a class="noteRef" id="n416.8src" href="#n416.8">8</a>
</p>
<p>The Sand-town people lost an advantage by their foolishness. Their new muskets and
ammunition were sunk. Not long before a trading vessel had come there.
</p>
<p>And before this, after things had been going on quietly at the [Ninstints] fort, Blown-away
went out from the fort to fish. When he came back from fishing his gambling sticks
were gone from the house. He then went to where they were gambling. He came to where
his nephew was using the gambling sticks.
</p>
<p>Then he scolded his nephew on account of them. And he (his nephew) threw the gambling
sticks over a cliff. He then pulled his nephew down on one side and stabbed him repeatedly.
And he ran toward the house. Then his (the murdered man’s) younger brother ran after
him. When he had almost got in his younger brother also stabbed him twice in the abdomen.
He, too, soon after was lying on the ground. A woman was also killed the same day.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsgo]
</p>
<p>In the days when they used arrows the Skidegate people went to Kloo to war. There
they kept watch. Near by were some women alone, digging roots. Near where the women
dug they had a large fire. They already had stones heated. Then they steamed their
nettle roots. The warriors were peering at them from behind. And the nettle roots
were cooked, and were cooked well. As they slipped the skins off they kept saying
“Wᴀha-iwa′n.”<a class="noteRef" id="n418.1src" href="#n418.1">1</a>
</p>
<p>And, when they had finished this, they came out to them. They enslaved the women.
And, after they had brought them to Skidegate, they also owned the made-up word there
that they had obtained on the expedition. They said “Ha-iwa′n” when they did anything.
The Kloo people then learned that they had captured the made-up word. And four canoe
loads of people went from Kloo to Skidegate to make war.
</p>
<p>They then pulled up their canoes on the inner side of Gū′łga and concealed themselves
there. After they had remained in hiding for a while three persons went by below them
in a canoe. The one in the middle was light-looking and stout. His hair hung down
loose.
</p>
<p>They then passed behind a point. Then they launched one good-sized canoe and pursued
them. And they saw that they were near. One of those in the bow then caught up a bow
and shot an arrow over them. When it fell near the bow all three at once looked around.
And they said to each other that it was Owner.<a class="noteRef" id="n418.2src" href="#n418.2">2</a> They came then alongside of his canoe and killed them all.
</p>
<p>They took the head of Owner, and they did the same to those who were with him. Then
they had their three heads stuck up on poles at Kloo. The Town-of-Djī′gua people made
immediately another new word, “without-even-looking-back.”<a class="noteRef" id="n418.3src" href="#n418.3">3</a> And when the news of that reached Skidegate they, in turn, were ashamed.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>After some time had elapsed the Kloo and Skidegate people began again to visit back
and forth. Then the Skidegate people came to Blood-fort. And, having determined to
kill them, Koagia′ns counted the people. They then destroyed them. Not even the skin
was scratched on their own side.
</p>
<p>And, after they had killed all, a youth was missing from among them. They then launched
a canoe and hunted for him. He had <span class="pageNum" id="pb419">[<a href="#pb419">419</a>]</span>jumped into the water. He sat close to the edge of the sea on the point on which the
fort stood. They then found him. The Skidegate man begged for mercy. On account of
that they called the place “Begging-for-mercy-cove.” And they killed him, too. Then
a great quantity of blood ran in the fort. So they called it “Blood-fort.”
</p>
<p>Some time afterward a woman of the Common-food-steamers<a class="noteRef" id="n419.4src" href="#n419.4">4</a> who was married among the Ninstints people brought over food to her friends in Kloo.
They found Kloo empty. They were afraid because they had destroyed the Skidegate people
at Blood-fort. They were all at Tꜝā′łdi.<a class="noteRef" id="n419.5src" href="#n419.5">5</a> It was then that she arrived.
</p>
<p>They slept then in the woods near the town of Kloo. One of the two slaves who were
with her told them to camp there [instead of on the beach]. And he also heard the
sound of paddling. He said then to his mistress: “I say, let us go in over there.
Some people passed here in the night in canoes.” But his mistress did not believe
what he said, and they passed in on the south side of the island.
</p>
<p>When they were going across the inlet they plainly saw some people launching their
canoes at a good sand beach. And they (the strangers) chased them back. They then
drove them ashore in terror. Her companions escaped to the woods, and she remained
behind alone. She did not let them pull her in, but laid her head on the edge of the
canoe.
</p>
<p>And she said: “Hurry, cut off my head. I do not want to be a slave. I do not want
to run away frightened either. Cut off my head quickly. Just here, my brother used
to say, yours were easily cut off.”<a class="noteRef" id="n419.6src" href="#n419.6">6</a> She made a mark around her neck, and she kept talking. They then cut off her head.
And all that were with her escaped into the woods.
</p>
<p>They got the news at Tꜝā′łdi, where all were living. They were shut up there for a
while as if they had been surrounded in one house. By and by the Skidegate people
again came to war. Opposite to the place where they had drawn up their canoes some
one was chopping down a cedar for a canoe. He felled it and went away.
</p>
<p>Then they (the Skidegate people) asked the oldest of the warriors: “When you used
to chop down a cedar how did you think about it during the night?” “I thought all
night what one does when the woman he is in love with accepts him. He will come to
it again very early.”
</p>
<p>They then took three men over to it during the night. When he came there early in
the morning, they killed him. Then they went over and got them.<a class="noteRef" id="n419.7src" href="#n419.7">7</a>
</p>
<p>They then fell unexpectedly upon some who came out of Tꜝā′łdi by canoe. One drew himself
up into a tree which bent over the water. He alone escaped. They killed the rest.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb420">[<a href="#pb420">420</a>]</span></p>
<p>During all that autumn, until the very beginning of winter, there were enemies around
them. They were never free from them.
</p>
<p>Then the man whose sister had been killed up the inlet from Kloo could not get a canoe.
By and by Ginᴀ′skilas<a class="noteRef" id="n420.8src" href="#n420.8">8</a> lent him a 5-fathom canoe without thwarts fastened in it. And he and his younger
brother finished it. After they had finished it he (Ginᴀ′skilas) changed his mind
[about lending it]. And Alder called out to his younger brother: “Kꜝwi′dᴀña-i,<a class="noteRef" id="n420.9src" href="#n420.9">9</a> cut off the cedar limbs from the canoe at once. If he says a word against it I will
kill him.” He then cut them off. They took no notice of it. And he could not get a
canoe.
</p>
<p>All winter no one took a step anywhere. By and by one of them went out to sea for
something, yet came back safely. They saw that spring was already beginning to come
on. Then Alder and Grandson went to Skidegate to war together.
</p>
<p>Those who remained behind felt that the earth was different. The ground shook, and
the thunder rolled directly over them, and there were landslides. A woman of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o,
Woman-too-dirty-to-be-touched,<a class="noteRef" id="n420.10src" href="#n420.10">10</a> owned four large clam shells, duck feathers, and duck grease. She laid them (the
clam shells) down and put the duck grease into them. She put duck feathers along the
edges. She sat talking to them: “Be careful, your duck grease might spill.” And it
stopped. She believed it was stopped by her actions.<a class="noteRef" id="n420.11src" href="#n420.11">11</a>
</p>
<p>The warriors arrived at Skidegate. Then they all (those left behind) got ready to
move at the same time. They had their canoes loaded and anchored at the mouth of the
creek. By and by, all started off together. That day they encamped at Xō′tdjix̣oa′s.<a class="noteRef" id="n420.12src" href="#n420.12">12</a> That night they remained awake. Amasa′n and his family acted as sentinels.
</p>
<p>The day after that they went off again. And, after they had moved on for a while,
they camped at Sqē′ługîts. The two who had gone to fight were also away. And, after
having escaped from confinement, they ate anything, having mussels and things in the
woods for provisions.
</p>
<p>Ginᴀ′skilas then went out to examine a peninsula opposite the camping place. And a
woman of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o, West-coast-clouds, and a slave also went out. And,
as they went along, they met the [two returning] warriors. Two scalps hung out of
the stern of the canoe. And they told her how they killed them.
</p>
<p>“We found Skidegate empty. But still we did not go into the houses.” Then they came
back [to the canoes]. They concealed their canoes at the seaward end of Skidegate.
Afterward they went to look at Skidegate. They found there sixty boxes of grease,
stowed away. They then broke them open with an ax. And the one whose sister’s head
had been cut off, while she was still alive, in the same way cut off the heads of
four youths who came after devilfishes.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb421">[<a href="#pb421">421</a>]</span></p>
<p>And she went along before the fighters shouting. From the place where Ginᴀ′skilas
had gone to make an examination some came along. And she shouted: “Ix̣iâ′⁺! Alder
and Grandson found the town of Skidegate empty. Their canoes are full.” She went toward
a large canoe coming toward her, telling the news. When she came near she recognized
Gᴀ′nx̣oat’s<a class="noteRef" id="n421.13src" href="#n421.13">13</a> canoe, named Sea-gull canoe.<a class="noteRef" id="n421.14src" href="#n421.14">14</a> She at once paddled the canoe around, and they escaped to land. Alder and Grandson
also landed there.
</p>
<p>And Grandson’s canoe was carried away by the wind. But before the Skidegate people
arrived Kī′dja-i<a class="noteRef" id="n421.15src" href="#n421.15">15</a> swam over to the canoe which was drifting away. And he did not care for the canoe,
but he took the two scalps and swam ashore with them. He moved backward, sitting down
with the two scalps in his mouth. “Now, <span class="corr" id="xd32e29571" title="Source: Gitî′ns">Gîtî′ns</span>,<a class="noteRef" id="n421.16src" href="#n421.16">16</a> I am glad to meet you.”
</p>
<p>And the Skidegate people got off to fight there. The Kloo people also came near from
Sqē′ługîts. They came together at once among the woods. Hu hu hu hu, there was a great
sound of guns there. A man of the Skidegate-town people<a class="noteRef" id="n421.17src" href="#n421.17">17</a> and one of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o<a class="noteRef" id="n421.18src" href="#n421.18">18</a> used to be good friends, and the Skidegate-town man shouted to him: “Property-always-running-about,
are you among them?” “Yes.” “Go home. When the Gîtî′ns become angry not even the grizzly
bear can stand against them.” “Indeed, I will go home. I was born a grizzly bear from
my parents, who are grizzly bears. They had me at the front [in war].”
</p>
<p>After they had fought there for a while Amasa′n and a Skidegate man shot at each other
over a thin rock at the edge of the woods, and they kept it up. Behind Amasa′n were
two persons, one of whom held a spear. He asked for it. They refused to give it to
him. He said that he would run over to the Skidegate man soon after he had shot him.<a class="noteRef" id="n421.19src" href="#n421.19">19</a> They did not give him the war spear.
</p>
<p>Then they fought there. After they had fought there for a while, and evening was coming
on, Tā′-iłgwai fell. He was wounded. On the other side Gidagā′ñgu also fell. They
then called out to each side to stop.<a class="noteRef" id="n421.20src" href="#n421.20">20</a> They then ceased shooting at each other, and the Skidegate people got into their
canoes. And the Town-of-Djī′gua people also got into their canoes when it was very
dark.
</p>
<p>When they (the women) escaped to land in fright Flood-tide-woman went up among the
mountains. When it became dark she went down cautiously toward the place where they
had camped. She was within a month of giving birth to a child.
</p>
<p>When she came near she heard some people laughing. And she (a woman among them) recognized
the voice of Gwai′îs. “Uncle Gwai′îs” [she said]. And he answered: “Ā′waiya, [I thought]
they had taken you.” She (Flood-tide-woman) had come to the one with whom he had been
in love.<a class="noteRef" id="n421.21src" href="#n421.21">21</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb422">[<a href="#pb422">422</a>]</span></p>
<p>And after they had camped there for a while one day, when the sea was smooth, they
went away. They looked at an island which lay seaward from them. Half of them refused
to use it. The rest wished to use it. The place was good for houses, but there was
no water. They remained there all the day.
</p>
<p>And they went away from it to Qꜝo′nakoa fort<a class="noteRef" id="n422.22src" href="#n422.22">22</a> and landed there. All said it was good. It was a good place to keep canoes. Then
they built little houses at the fort. When they were finished they began living in
them.
</p>
<p>Before the stockade and houses were completed one of the Peninsula people<a class="noteRef" id="n422.23src" href="#n422.23">23</a> who had married a woman of the Common-food-steamers brought over news to his brother-in-law.
He brought the news that Î′ldjiwas<a class="noteRef" id="n422.24src" href="#n422.24">24</a> had his canoe dug out in the rough. He had done that in order to go to war.
</p>
<p>Before he brought the news three persons in a canoe were fishing with floats. It was
raining in the inlet where they were. And, while they had the canoe turned bottom
up over them, the Skidegate people quickly turned over the canoe and killed them.
</p>
<p>He (the Peninsula man) stayed all night at Qꜝo′nakoa fort and went off the next day.
When evening came his smoke [was seen] rising from an island lying seaward.<a class="noteRef" id="n422.25src" href="#n422.25">25</a> Then the strongest men went out from the fort to see him. Where he was floating,
at Land-point, a big whale was drifting. He raised a smoke for his brothers-in-law
on account of that.
</p>
<p>The people of the fort then all went out for whale. And they encamped at G̣ᴀ′ldjida
for the whale. There they cut it up.
</p>
<p>Î′ldjiwas then had his canoe in the woods at Chicken-hawk town.<a class="noteRef" id="n422.26src" href="#n422.26">26</a> They observed the Town-of-Djī′gua people cut up the whale. By and by Two-voices went
to Chicken-hawk town to cut łg̣ēt<a class="noteRef" id="n422.27src" href="#n422.27">27</a> with two young men. After they had gone there they heard the sound of guns. They
shot Two-voices only. His companions they spared.
</p>
<p>Shortly after the guns sounded he (Î′ldjiwas) sailed by in front of the camping place.
He went too fast for them to even think of going out to him.
</p>
<p>And after they had waited a while for a good day they loaded the whale and went off
with it. And, although they wanted to go to Qꜝo′nakoa fort, the canoes were so heavy
that they went ashore at Dog-fish fort.<a class="noteRef" id="n422.28src" href="#n422.28">28</a> This fort was the best of all. And they cleared away the bushes and started to live
there. Ginᴀ′skilas owned blankets ornamented with duck bills (lit., “duck teeth”).
He hung them all around upon the stockade on account of a canoe that had come [with
visitors]. And, when these were not quite enough, he bought ten with a slave that
a woman owned. They used to get twenty slaves for a sea otter.
</p>
<p>In the following year all who were in Dog-fish fort went to Skidegate to war. And,
after they had pulled up their canoes into the <span class="pageNum" id="pb423">[<a href="#pb423">423</a>]</span>woods in the inlet above Skidegate, they were discovered. All of the Skidegate people
followed them at once. They shot at them. They shot one then in the canoes of the
Kloo people. They got off on the inner side of Ku′nga-i.<a class="noteRef" id="n423.29src" href="#n423.29">29</a>
</p>
<p>At that time the Town-of-Djī′gua people took to the woods. When they fled the one
who had been wounded sat in the canoe. Just before Tā′-iłgwai got off he called to
him: “Skî′lg̣atgwᴀns,” he said to him, “try to get off. Sit at the foot of a tree
in the woods. When I get to Cumshewa<a class="noteRef" id="n423.30src" href="#n423.30">30</a> I will borrow a canoe and get you as soon as I can.” Then he consented. He said:
“All right.”
</p>
<p>The Skidegate people then pulled off their canoes. Not long after that the one they
had wounded made a fire for his head. They then went over from Skidegate and cut off
his head.
</p>
<p>And the Town-of-Djī′gua people went around by the point, camping here and there. They
had nothing to eat. And when they camped they were cold. By and by they found a sea
otter floated ashore. They made a fire for it and steamed it in the ground. When it
was cooked they set some in front of Ginᴀ′skilas. But he said: “You put this in front
of me to eat, but I will not eat it. The gravel might see me.”<a class="noteRef" id="n423.31src" href="#n423.31">31</a>
</p>
<p>They then started off and came to Cumshewa. And they attacked Tā′-iłgwai, because
he did not do as he had promised [to the wounded man]. They then borrowed a canoe
at Cumshewa and went to Skedans.<a class="noteRef" id="n423.32src" href="#n423.32">32</a> They (the Skedans people) took them over to the fort.
</p>
<p>And, after they had remained there for a while and it was again fall, they again went
to Tꜝā′łdi. And, after they were through with gathering food, they again settled at
Dog-fish fort.
</p>
<p>And the summer after the succeeding winter some posts fell out of the stockade. Later
more fell. Then Gwi′sukūnas called his nephew and said to him: “Chief’s son, the women
can now go anywhere they want to. Fighting lies on its back. War is over.” From that
time it was ended.
</p>
<p>At this time chief Ginᴀ′skilas died. When Qā′-idjît became chief in his place they
had a town at Sea-grass.<a class="noteRef" id="n423.33src" href="#n423.33">33</a>

<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o]
</p>
<p>Once South-east<a class="noteRef" id="n425.1src" href="#n425.1">1</a> and the people of his town went trading. He came to I′nūł.<a class="noteRef" id="n425.2src" href="#n425.2">2</a> And, after they had given them food for a while, berries were dropped upon the face
of South-east, and Alder<a class="noteRef" id="n425.3src" href="#n425.3">3</a> did not like it. Then they began to fight at the fort. And they destroyed the men
and enslaved the women.
</p>
<p>They then discovered Axłua′ls swimming from the fort. Some youths pursued him. And,
when they got near him, one held a spear over his shoulder ready for him. He said
to him: “Spare me brother-in-law,” but still he speared him. He broke his back.
</p>
<p>They towed the body of Axłua′ls ashore. Those taken as slaves then sang the same song
for his body that had been sung for him when he acted in the secret societies and
got power from the sea otter and when he performed sleight-of-hand feats.
</p>
<p class="small">Lawē′⁺ huwā′⁺hō⁺ hō⁺ lawē′⁺ī iä′⁺ la⁺wē′⁺ huyä′ u ō⁺ lawē′⁺ hu wä⁺
<br>ō⁺ lawē′⁺ hē⁺ iyä′⁺ ō⁺ ōō⁺ lawē′⁺ī⁺ iyä′⁺ō⁺
<br>ō⁺ lawē′⁺ yē⁺ huwä′⁺ ō⁺ hō⁺ lawē′ēē⁺ hēhē⁺
iyä′⁺ ō⁺ ō⁺ lawē′⁺ hē hē iyä′wâ wâ⁺.
</p>
<p>At that time they took forty slaves for South-east. All together, they took seventy
at that time. When they came home they started to fortify themselves at Thin-fort.<a class="noteRef" id="n425.4src" href="#n425.4">4</a>
</p>
<p>And, after they had been there for a while, Djē′basa<a class="noteRef" id="n425.5src" href="#n425.5">5</a> came with many canoes. They stopped in front of the fort and bought them (the slaves)
for grease, hides, and slaves. And, after he had bought all and had started off, a
woman whose lip around her labret was broken through, the only one left, came out
and stood there, and said: “Djē′basa, chief Djē′basa, are you going to let your property
rot at such-and-such a place where it is stowed?<a class="noteRef" id="n425.6src" href="#n425.6">6</a> Are you going to let it rot at such-and-such another place where it is stowed?”<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n425.6asrc" href="#n425.6">6</a>
</p>
<p>Then the canoe was backed toward her, and he gathered the boxes of grease which were
in the canoe together and landed them in exchange for her. Then she also got in, and
they went away.
</p>
<p>When they first arrived there Djē′basa ate dry fish and grease in the canoe. They
saw that his mind was good. And South-east began to speak of building a house with
what he had obtained in exchange for the slaves. And they were glad, and the Town-of-Djī′gua
people sang a song outside.
</p>
<p class="small">Wai⁺ aiyā′⁺ aiyā′⁺ aiyā′⁺aiyā′ uyâ⁺ uyâ⁺ ayā⁺ ayā⁺ wâ
<br>ai′ya⁺ aiyā′ha⁺ aiyā′ha aiyā′ha haiyā′haho haiyā′hahē, etc.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb426">[<a href="#pb426">426</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the time they sang they made a forward motion, and when they moved much the platform
fell. No one was injured. Then one of them asked his child: “Hî′ndju, is your brother
there?” They then sang another song: “Hî′ndju, is your brother there?”
</p>
<p>They removed then from the fort to Chicken-hawk town.<a class="noteRef" id="n426.7src" href="#n426.7">7</a> But there they built houses. After this a long time elapsed before there was another
fight. South-east was dead, and Ginᴀ′skilas<a class="noteRef" id="n426.8src" href="#n426.8">8</a> was also dead, and Qā′-idjît<a class="noteRef" id="n426.9src" href="#n426.9">9</a> succeeded to his place. Then they cleared the town of Sea-grass.<a class="noteRef" id="n426.10src" href="#n426.10">10</a> He built Cave-house<a class="noteRef" id="n426.11src" href="#n426.11">11</a> there.
</p>
<p>And while Qā′-idjît was sitting idle in front of his house with a Pebble-town woman,<a class="noteRef" id="n426.12src" href="#n426.12">12</a> whom he had married, Those-born-at-Skedans<a class="noteRef" id="n426.13src" href="#n426.13">13</a> came from Skedans<a class="noteRef" id="n426.14src" href="#n426.14">14</a> to fight with him. They shot at him, and his wife fell dead without uttering a word.
But he got in safe. Then he kept sending food through the fire to his wife.<a class="noteRef" id="n426.15src" href="#n426.15">15</a> That made him soon forget about his wife.
</p>
<p>And when summer came he married a woman of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o.<a class="noteRef" id="n426.16src" href="#n426.16">16</a> The brother of the one that was killed also stayed there. His name was Lū′g̣ot.<a class="noteRef" id="n426.17src" href="#n426.17">17</a>
</p>
<p>One day Qā′-idjît painted himself and tied weasel skins in his hair, in order to set
out to eat berries. He started off. Lū′g̣ot had made a canoe and was smoothing it
there. When his brother-in-law was on the point of starting off he ran down toward
his brother-in-law. And he threw sand into Qā′-idjît’s face.<a class="noteRef" id="n426.18src" href="#n426.18">18</a>
</p>
<p>And he asked for two guns which were in the bow. They were afraid to hand them to
him then. By and by they handed him one, and he shot his brother-in-law. He shot true
and killed him.
</p>
<p>Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o bestirred themselves at once and fired at him. They shot
him in the elbow. Then he lay there. That day three were killed. Qā′-idjît was made
to sit on the sand. But still Qā′-idjît escaped into the house. And he lay in the
back part of Cave-house. He had two large blankets over him. Over these he also had
a cotton canoe sail.
</p>
<p>Now those who had done that to him went to a lonely camping place. And afterward they
were afraid he was alive. They came to kill him. It was moonlight. A boy who was sleeping
with him woke him. He then pulled himself out from under the blankets. And, while
he moved back from the fire, one was moving a pistol<a class="noteRef" id="n426.19src" href="#n426.19">19</a> about in the smoke hole. He tried to shoot him. Twice his pistol failed to go off.
Then two guns were pointed through the smoke hole. When they went off there were large
holes in the blankets.
</p>
<p>One day, some time afterward, he went out in front of the house and sat idle. After
he had sat there for a while they stepped toward him. He heard the sound of running
feet. And, after he had aimed his gun in that direction for some time, Naskiä′ł<a class="noteRef" id="n426.20src" href="#n426.20">20</a> stuck out his head, and he shot at his face. He fell there on his face.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb427">[<a href="#pb427">427</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of those who came to attack him from the camp Naskiä′ł was killed. And the one who
was with him went away. And another family looked after the body. Afterward Qā′-idjît
went to Gᴀ′nx̣oat, who was living in Big-house.<a class="noteRef" id="n427.21src" href="#n427.21">21</a> There he died. And his grandfather put him into a big box.
</p>
<p>Then the people who had shot him and were holding a fort in Lake inlet<a class="noteRef" id="n427.22src" href="#n427.22">22</a> brought over a peace offering.<a class="noteRef" id="n427.23src" href="#n427.23">23</a> They brought over one slave. And the next year they also held a fort up the inlet
from Sea-grass town. Thither Two-in-one came from Daog̣ā′iłgᴀłgîñ, which lies seaward
from Skedans, and got him. They came and got Naskiä′ł<a class="noteRef" id="n427.24src" href="#n427.24">24</a> to go to war with the Gîtā′mat.<a class="noteRef" id="n427.25src" href="#n427.25">25</a> He went at once.
</p>
<p>They then set out. There, at Gîtā′mat, they took many slaves for him. Two-in-one,<a class="noteRef" id="n427.26src" href="#n427.26">26</a> however, had three. And, when they returned, they built two large houses at Atā′na.<a class="noteRef" id="n427.27src" href="#n427.27">27</a> Presently they came to him to ask for blood money. They gave then five slaves. And
Those-born-at-Skedans named their island “Sunny-fort.”<a class="noteRef" id="n427.28src" href="#n427.28">28</a> By selling the slaves that remained Naskiä′ł built a house. There they say he began
to potlatch. Now they went from Sea-grass town to get his house timbers. And they
built his house at Sea-grass town. This is how they got back to Sea-grass town.
</p>
<p>After that time they procured more expensive seats [at the feasts and potlatches].<a class="noteRef" id="n427.29src" href="#n427.29">29</a> They now ceased to have trouble at Sea-grass town.
</p>
<p>Here this ends.
</p>
<p class="small">Kitkatla was an important town and tribe belonging to the Tsimshian stock. The town
was on Dolphin island.

<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham<span id="xd32e29896"></span> of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o]
</p>
<p>The people at Chicken-hawk<a class="noteRef" id="n429.1src" href="#n429.1">1</a> town were at Wā′nats<a class="noteRef" id="n429.2src" href="#n429.2">2</a> prepared for war and had done raising their canoes. They were going to Kitamat.<a class="noteRef" id="n429.3src" href="#n429.3">3</a> And because the tides began to run too high for them to make the start from Chicken-hawk
town, they prepared at ʟłasū′g̣a-i. When the tide was high they started off.
</p>
<p>Then some Skedans<a class="noteRef" id="n429.4src" href="#n429.4">4</a> people met them. And they gave them the following news. Bufflehead had thrown a dry
halibut at Î′ngîlîn,<a class="noteRef" id="n429.5src" href="#n429.5">5</a> on account of which there was a fight.<a class="noteRef" id="n429.6src" href="#n429.6">6</a> They heard that a woman of the Town-of-Djī′gua people<a class="noteRef" id="n429.7src" href="#n429.7">7</a> had been killed. Then, instead [of keeping on], they went toward the Tsimshian.<a class="noteRef" id="n429.8src" href="#n429.8">8</a>
</p>
<p>They went on and took all the dry salmon a slave was getting in Skidegate creek<a class="noteRef" id="n429.9src" href="#n429.9">9</a> away from him. They took a large number of bundles of salmon out of the canoe of
one who was coming back from war. After they had left that place they took away all
the property of some people who were living at Da′x̣ua.<a class="noteRef" id="n429.10src" href="#n429.10">10</a>
</p>
<p>They then went seaward and came to the mouth of the Skeena. And they went toward <span class="corr" id="xd32e29981" title="Source: Metlakatla">Metlakahtla</span><a class="noteRef" id="n429.11src" href="#n429.11">11</a> and pulled their canoe up into the woods. Close behind them were very many people
in a temporary camp. After some time had elapsed they began to make a noise. They
then went to fight.
</p>
<p>When they came out of the woods a Tsimshian shot a Haida. “A,” he was glad to have
shot him. Then some Tsimshian got into a medium-sized canoe and paddled off in fright.
And the Kloo people also got into one. The Tsimshian had one paddle, and the fighters
also had one.
</p>
<p>And after they had chased them for a while, they chased them ashore and seized them
at the edge of the water. Only one escaped to the woods. When they seized his wife
she cried out, and he turned around quickly with a knife. Then Djix̣ia′al ran toward
him. When he got near he shouted at him. He (the Tsimshian) shook, and he seized him.
</p>
<p>They then got into the two canoes and went over to the place where they had come out.
They went over to the war canoes that were there. On an island on which stood one
tree, near the place where they came out, sat Nî′swas.<a class="noteRef" id="n429.12src" href="#n429.12">12</a> And the people of his town also sat there. The Kloo people were unaware of it.
</p>
<p>And, when they started off, one [Tsimshian] who was a good hunter started after something
[from the camp of Nî′swas]. He shot at them. Then they started back.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb430">[<a href="#pb430">430</a>]</span></p>
<p>They came across then, and the warriors came to Raven-creek.<a class="noteRef" id="n430.13src" href="#n430.13">13</a> Two canoes landed at a house that stood on the farther side of High-point.<a class="noteRef" id="n430.14src" href="#n430.14">14</a> After they had remained for a while in that house a Skidegate man who used to be
on good terms with a Kloo man ran in through the doorway. Instead of sitting idle,
Qena′-i’s father<a class="noteRef" id="n430.15src" href="#n430.15">15</a> picked up his weapons. One of them held ready before the door an ax which he had
in his hands. He brought news over in advance that people were coming over from High-point
town<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="n430.14asrc" href="#n430.14">14</a> to fight them.
</p>
<p>Then they (the assailants) went back. And they also went away. When the sun had passed
behind the hills, they arrived at Chicken-hawk town. At that time they sang a high
song. They had brought in ten slaves.
</p>
<p>Then one whose canoe was empty went into Kitamat for a short raid. After he had been
gone for a while they heard the sound of his guns. While they were living at Kloo
he brought in two slaves. They took them for Kog̣ogwa′ñ. By trading these he built
a house. It was named “Î′ngîlîn-house.”<a class="noteRef" id="n430.16src" href="#n430.16">16</a>
</p>
<p>Some time after this they went to war on the Tsimshian in two canoes. Gîtku′n<a class="noteRef" id="n430.17src" href="#n430.17">17</a> and Gitagᴀ′ñgiasʟas went. After they got into the Tsimshian country they landed their
canoes near <span class="corr" id="xd32e30036" title="Source: Metlakatla">Metlakahtla</span>. After they had sat there for a while five persons came in a canoe after devilfish.
There were three women and two men, and the warriors ran toward them in the woods.
</p>
<p>The chief did not get off. But the others walked about on shore. They took then the
wife of Nîsʟā′ganūs, and they also took the wife of his nephew. And they seized the
other woman in the woods. She was very pretty, and they lay with her there and let
her go.
</p>
<p>They pushed them along then to the place where the canoes were. And, when they started
off, Nîsʟā′ganūs’s nephew walked about on the opposite shore. He shot at them many
times, but the gunpowder only flashed. By and by they pulled out of range. And they
went seaward to Sqä′g̣ał. And, when they started across, they sang a high song at
Kloo.<a class="noteRef" id="n430.18src" href="#n430.18">18</a> And they owned her (the chief’s wife) there. The winter was not long for him (Gîtku′n).<a class="noteRef" id="n430.19src" href="#n430.19">19</a>
</p>
<p>The Tsimshian then came to fight for her in a crowd. And, when they camped at Qal,<a class="noteRef" id="n430.20src" href="#n430.20">20</a> Häl<a class="noteRef" id="n430.21src" href="#n430.21">21</a> sent a canoe to talk with them. He had them tell the people that he was going to
come for her. When harvest time<a class="noteRef" id="n430.22src" href="#n430.22">22</a> came, after he had said he would come back in many canoes, a great many Kîtkatla
people came by canoe to Skedans. It was a veritable crowd.
</p>
<p>They stayed at the town of Skedans. The Kloo people also crossed thither. The great
Häl got Kꜝuia′ns’s<a class="noteRef" id="n430.23src" href="#n430.23">23</a> sister and another woman who had been taken south to the Bellabella.<a class="noteRef" id="n430.24src" href="#n430.24">24</a> He brought both over.
</p>
<p>On the night when the Kloo people came he began to dance. After he had done this for
a while he sent the two Ninstints people [to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb431">[<a href="#pb431">431</a>]</span>Kloo people] by striking them on the back. They struck Gîtku′n with a slave,<a class="noteRef" id="n431.25src" href="#n431.25">25</a> and Gidᴀ′ñgiasʟas also went away with one. The chiefs were in Mother-house.<a class="noteRef" id="n431.26src" href="#n431.26">26</a>
</p>
<p>After he had ceased dancing, Gîtku′n also started to dance. After he had done so for
a while, and had stopped, they had the wife of Nîsʟā′ganūs stand up, and the other
with her. And, when they struck her on the back to send her to the other side, she
almost touched the ground with her lips. They did the same thing to the other one.
In this way they exchanged.
</p>
<p>After they got back to Kloo Kꜝuia′ns and Kꜝadja′-i paid for their sisters. Kꜝuia′ns
paid two slaves for his sister, along with sea otters. Kꜝadja′-i also paid a slave
for his sister, besides much property and many guns.
</p>
<p>After this winter came. When spring came Gîtku′n joined the secret society. At the
end of two days he disappeared into the woods. On the next day all the Kloo people
went to Skedans. When they set out they launched his canoe, which was called “Reef-canoe.”<a class="noteRef" id="n431.27src" href="#n431.27">27</a>
</p>
<p>After they had loaded for a while, some came down in a crowd out of Cave-house with
a sail pulled tightly around them. Inside of it many horns sounded. They got into
the canoe and started across. It went along in the midst of the other canoes, and
something whistled inside of the sail. All thought that Gîtku′n was in it.
</p>
<p>When they got near Skedans Reef-canoe changed still more. They let the one who had
fallen [that is, joined the secret society] at Kloo be inspired at Skedans. When they
stood in front of Skedans, he (the spirit) suddenly made a noise behind Skedans, and
Skedans was in commotion. Hu hu, hu hu hu, Wā′nᴀg̣ᴀn<a class="noteRef" id="n431.28src" href="#n431.28">28</a> also acted ū′lala in a different place. At this time they were so much taken up with
it that they did not know what they did. When they got Wā′nᴀg̣ᴀn into Mother-house,
the companions also attended to Gîtku′n. They got him into Rotten-house.<a class="noteRef" id="n431.29src" href="#n431.29">29</a> They then came ashore.
</p>
<p>The day after this, about noon, Wā′nᴀg̣ᴀn went out and bit the arms of the sons of
Skedans chiefs belonging to good families.<a class="noteRef" id="n431.30src" href="#n431.30">30</a> After a time he bit the arm of Gā-iñᴀ′ldᴀña-i-yū′ᴀns<span class="corr" id="xd32e30111" title="Source: .">,</span> when he too joined the secret society. He was inspired. On the day after that Gā-iñᴀ′ldᴀña-i-yū′ᴀns
went out and [feigned to] eat a Bellabella woman that his mother owned.<a class="noteRef" id="n431.31src" href="#n431.31">31</a> As he sat and moved around her she pushed him from her and made a sound as if she
feared him. By and by he seized her and began to eat her. When he began to bite her
neck she died. The companions took care of him. He ate to the middle of her.
</p>
<p>One day, when the secret society was at <span class="corr" id="xd32e30119" title="Source: it">its</span> height, it was foggy. At that time the two brothers of Nîsʟā′gañūs’ wife came to
fight. They were Nīstadâ′ and Nîsūłna′tc.
</p>
<p>During three days and nights it was foggy at sea. After that, when <span class="pageNum" id="pb432">[<a href="#pb432">432</a>]</span>they made land very early in the morning, they saw it (land) all at once. They then
pulled up their canoe on Gwa′-idjats.<a class="noteRef" id="n432.32src" href="#n432.32">32</a>
</p>
<p>Just at daybreak the sound of the bad secret society came to their ears. When day
broke they discovered that they were coming out to them in a canoe. In the bow of
the canoe persons were acting under the influence of the spirits of the bad<a class="noteRef" id="n432.33src" href="#n432.33">33</a> secret society. They made noises, and they said to each other that they smelt them.
They fled then. They forgot the board which holds the foot of the mast. Then some
who had gone after sea eggs shouted as they came back [at seeing] their white sail
pass out to sea from Skedans. Then they split in two some boxes of grease that they
had and made a hole in the bottom with an adze. Then one of them, lying on his back,
held it there with his feet. When they were some distance away they passed round in
a crooked course. Then they made a board to hold the foot of the mast at Skidegate
creek. After this time the people of the two islands had the board to hold the foot
of the mast nailed down inside the bow.
</p>
<p>The next fine day after this they went home. They found their minds were different,
and they found their own country.
</p>
<p>And, when the secret society was all over, they (the people) returned to Kloo. When
the middle of the following summer arrived they came to get something for having had
their sister enslaved. They were allowed to land without disturbance. Before any food
was given to them they started to dance.<a class="noteRef" id="n432.34src" href="#n432.34">34</a>
</p>
<p>“Hō⁺ hō⁺ hī hō⁺ hī⁺ hō⁺ hī⁺ hō⁺ hī⁺ hō⁺ hī hō⁺ hōga haaa hoga hog̣a ha ha gudixē′”
[they sang].
</p>
<p>They put a dance hat on Nīstᴀdâ′. They also struck Nîsūłna′tc with a copper plate
(that is, they gave it to him). And he danced, holding it by means of his neck [and
chin]. Hu hu hu hu, it was a great dance. The town people also struck him with some
property.
</p>
<p>This is the end. They had peace with each other.

<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham of <span class="corr" id="xd32e30151" title="Source: Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsgo">Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o</span>]
</p>
<p>One time, when they were ready to go fishing toward the south, Waters was dead at
Sea-grass town.<a class="noteRef" id="n434.1src" href="#n434.1">1</a> A Tsimshian named Wās was a close friend of his and came to send food through the
fire to him. He had four canoes loaded with boxes of grease. From him they learned
the news. The Tsimshian told them that the Bellabella<a class="noteRef" id="n434.2src" href="#n434.2">2</a> of the whole inlet had their canoes all ready to make war on the Eagle people.<a class="noteRef" id="n434.3src" href="#n434.3">3</a> They did not believe the news.
</p>
<p>After they had bought their grease they went away. Then the Kloo people also went
southward, and after they had gone on for a while they landed at a long sandy beach,
and a shaman named Dī′g̣a-koya′k<sup>u</sup><a class="noteRef" id="n434.4src" href="#n434.4">4</a> performed there. His supernatural powers saw that the Bellabella were coming that
day. He said that his powers had looked at something out at sea.
</p>
<p>A Ninstints man who had been taken before acted as pilot for the Bellabella. His name
was Youngest-chief’s-son. And toward evening the Bellabella saw the fires. They asked
Youngest-chief’s-son: “Which have the bigger fire?” And he said: “The Ninstints people’s
fire is the larger. The fire of Gîtku′n’s<a class="noteRef" id="n434.5src" href="#n434.5">5</a> people is the smaller.” The Bellabella then turned toward that.
</p>
<p>The canoes then gathered near the camping place. After they were assembled [on shore]
they ran out quickly. One then seized a woman who was behind the house, and she knocked
the Bellabella down. The Bellabella still clung to her. The woman then seized a short
stick and struck him on the head with it. She then ran away from the Bellabella.
</p>
<p>And afterward the Bellabella canoes came along. Two also walked along on shore. There
they enslaved a Kloo man and his wife. And they enslaved seven Kloo people at Qꜝo′na.<a class="noteRef" id="n434.6src" href="#n434.6">6</a>
</p>
<p>And after he (a certain one) had tried to shoot [some one] near Gī′tgua fort he came
to one who was hammering silver. And, when he got near him, he pulled the trigger
of his gun without taking aim. It went off, and he ran quickly to him and tried to
cut off his head. But, since he was looking to see if any were coming after him, he
cut on the chest. The Bellabella took in the body and went to G̣adō′. And they breakfasted
there and slept in their canoes on the farther side of G̣ᴀ′nʟ̣gîn.<a class="noteRef" id="n434.7src" href="#n434.7">7</a>
</p>
<p>And, while it was yet daylight, the singing of a child came to their ears from the
other side of Xēna.<a class="noteRef" id="n434.8src" href="#n434.8">8</a> Winōʟalū′sila<span class="corr" id="xd32e30193" title="Source: .">,</span> who had taken no <span class="pageNum" id="pb435">[<a href="#pb435">435</a>]</span>one, went to the place where the child was singing. They were encamped behind the
trees, and had a mat hung up on account of the mosquitoes. He softly pulled it down.
He saw those lying behind it. At that time some one said to him “<span class="corr" id="xd32e30198" title="Source: Nda′,nda′">Nda′, nda′</span>.” He thought it was a dog. And, after he had also looked on the other side, he went
again to the place where they were camping.
</p>
<p>He then told them how many there were, and he said that he alone would have them.
And he went thither. As he went toward the place his gun went off. And those who were
behind ran up. When they got near he had come out near them on shore. He had cut off
a head. His skin was covered with blood. Holding the head hanging from his mouth,
he crept down with two knives in his hands. There they enslaved five.
</p>
<p>They told them there that many people were encamped at Xēna-point. The Kloo people
told that to the Bellabella. They then went to Xēna-point. And they arrived there,
and, after they had gathered together, they lay in lines along the edges of the grass.
Presently they went to get them. After they had gone in a line toward them for a while,
they said “Hūk”<a class="noteRef" id="n435.9src" href="#n435.9">9</a> and threw themselves upon them. And there, too, they enslaved many Kloo people. Some,
however, escaped into the woods.
</p>
<p>After they had got them into the canoe a north wind was blowing. They then put up
their sails. Many dead bodies were left behind them. And, when they got far out to
sea, they pulled off the head of a man of the Cumshewa-town people<a class="noteRef" id="n435.10src" href="#n435.10">10</a> named Sʟins who sat in the canoe, and threw his body overboard while it was still
alive.
</p>
<p>Then those who had escaped into the woods met at Skwa′-ikun island. And they went
toward the mainland on rafts. They then made a big smoke toward Ninstints. And they
came after them at once and took them over to Ninstints. Afterward, when evening came,
they took them over to where they (their own people) were fishing. It was a great
piece of bad news. There was no peace for a single family.
</p>
<p>They stopped fishing then and went to Sea-grass town. After they had gone along for
a while they came to the body of the man whose head they had taken off, floating near
the shore. They put it into the fire there.<a class="noteRef" id="n435.11src" href="#n435.11">11</a> And they took along his bones. They reached Sea-grass town. Hu hu hu hu hu, there
was great wailing. They now prepared for war. After they had prepared slowly for a
while they went off.
</p>
<p>At that time they were not acquainted with the mouth of Bellabella strait. Then, without
knowing [where they were], they pulled up their canoes into the woods early in the
morning. And, when day dawned, they saw Wawayiê′la’s fort. The fort was named Lai′ʟaikꜝia-i.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb436">[<a href="#pb436">436</a>]</span></p>
<p>And, when evening came, they wanted to see which side was the best one on which to
get off. And they went around it while the Bellabella slept. Many log houses were
on the lower part of the point of the island. They saw it, and they went away. They
then talked it over, hu hu hu hu hu.<a class="noteRef" id="n436.12src" href="#n436.12">12</a> On the day after the next they went toward it just before daylight.
</p>
<p>And, after they had gone along for a while, when the bows were coming in in front
of the log houses the bundles of masts in the bows pushed back the canoes.
</p>
<p>The fort people had sung all night for Wawayiê′la, who was acting in the secret society,
and slept for weariness from using their voices. When they were asleep they (the Haida)
came in front of them.
</p>
<p>After some of them had got near some one came out to urinate and discovered them.
The Bellabella then began to shoot at them. And when daylight came the Town-of-Djī′gua
people<a class="noteRef" id="n436.13src" href="#n436.13">13</a> went ashore by a reef lying off the point of the island. They then shot on their
side. Hu hu hu hu hu, there was a great noise of guns.
</p>
<p>By and by they mentioned to Gūnana′otx̣a<a class="noteRef" id="n436.14src" href="#n436.14">14</a> that they might make peace, but, when the Kloo people came out on the reef, they
began to shoot at them again. At that time they killed a chief of the Town-of-Djī′gua
people. They tried then to get his body, which was high up on a rock, from behind.
And some one thought of a hook he had in one of his boxes. They then fastened this
to the end of a pole, pulled it through the skin, and by pulling a little at a time
they got it in.
</p>
<p>They shot at each other all day. By and by they got into their canoes and started
away. They shot at them from the fort. They also shot into some who were ashore. When
all got away they pursued them from the fort. They were so strong that they escaped
at that time by canoe.
</p>
<p>They came back then empty-handed. And they (the people at home) felt good, because
while the warriors were gone a man and his wife had escaped and had returned. But,
when they brought back the dead body, they felt still more sorrowful than before.
They could do nothing.
</p>
<p>That winter news came to the Bellabella through a canoe from the Kitkatla people that
when summer came Gîtku′n was going to sweep out the inlet from its head like a contagion.
Then the Bellabella people said: “When Gîldā′-ił<a class="noteRef" id="n436.15src" href="#n436.15">15</a> can never be entered how are you going to sweep it out from the head?” When that
news came through Kitkatla,<a class="noteRef" id="n436.16src" href="#n436.16">16</a> the Town-of-Djī′gua people said they would destroy everything before them as when
one spits out something.
</p>
<p>At that time Ya′koeʟas was showing how he would act when they got hold of him. Ten
Bellabella young men seized him, and he threw them about. He said that he would do
that to the Kloo people. And in the very middle of summer they went southward fishing.
They <span class="pageNum" id="pb437">[<a href="#pb437">437</a>]</span>fished there for a long time. They observed the war taboos there for a long time.
They drank medicine. And, when they had more than enough dried halibut, they went
away.
</p>
<p>When they found a good sandy beach they landed. Thence they started off to war. Hu
hu hu hu hu, the great crowd of them! After they had prepared for a while they went
off. While they were away the women observed the rules in two smokehouses. After ten
nights had passed, and the bows [of the <span class="corr" id="xd32e30280" title="Source: warriors">warriors’</span>] canoes were turned about, and they had started home, they turned around their sleeping
places.<a class="noteRef" id="n437.17src" href="#n437.17">17</a> One night after that they came home. The noise of guns was heard.
</p>
<p>Hu hu hu hu hu, there was a great noise of guns. When they got near, the sound of
the war songs came rolling along. In Waters’s canoe the highest war song was sung.<a class="noteRef" id="n443.18src" href="#n443.18">18</a> When they landed they brought in many slaves. Among them was the great chief, Ya′koeʟas.
</p>
<p>At that time they went up into the inlet. They spent many days in it. And when they
smelt smoke some went out to scout. They then saw the house, and before daybreak they
set out for the house in a line.
</p>
<p>When they got near a white man’s dog barked at them. At that time A′nkustᴀ<a class="noteRef" id="n443.19src" href="#n443.19">19</a> performed as shaman. He then made a threatening motion toward the dog. It stopped
barking. And it came among them and licked them.
</p>
<p>When they got near they shot at them. Hu hu hu hu hu, they finished shooting and ran
in. Some went through the doorway and some went in through the sides of the house.
They dropped in quickly in any way. They seized at once upon those inside.
</p>
<p>By and by one of them seized Ya′koeʟas. He threw him from him, and he almost fell
on his hands near by. But he did not loosen his hands. Those in the house did not
know, on account of the confusion, what they were doing. One lay upon some one and
called for his family. Others pulled away his arms.<a class="noteRef" id="n443.20src" href="#n443.20">20</a>
</p>
<p>They now got all into their hands. At that time they lay upon some slaves owned by
Ya′koeʟas who had married each other. The woman then said to her husband: “Cut him
up among them.” And her husband said to her: “Any place where water is drunk is all
right.” Their minds were not disturbed, because they were slaves already.
</p>
<p>Then the chief, Ya′koeʟas, refused to leave the place. The Kloo people then seized
him, and he threw them off with a jerk. He then moved himself little by little in
the place where he had lain. He moved toward an ax that was there.
</p>
<p>After they had struggled with him for a while one of them found a big coil of rope
near the door. They tied him then. And they carried him to the canoe. At that time
he was put into Waters’s canoe. The canoe then moved as if some one shook it. It shook
because he was afraid, and they were afraid of him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb438">[<a href="#pb438">438</a>]</span></p>
<p>The one who had escaped from among the Kloo people first captured by the Bellabella
then threw a spear at him out of another canoe, and he raised his palm toward it,
so that the spear ran into his palm. On that account he also struck Ya′koeʟas in the
face with a paddle. He [Ya′koeʟas] did not turn away. He held up his head as before.
</p>
<p>After he had been shaking [with fear] for a while Waters put on him a cedar-bark ring
that they had taken. Then, knowing that the cedar-bark ring protected him from insult,
he found that his life was safe.
</p>
<p>When it was broad daylight the Bellabella said that some people lived below on the
inlet. Two canoes of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o<a class="noteRef" id="n438.21src" href="#n438.21">21</a> started off. These were not anxious for their lives, because they had taken nothing.
</p>
<p>And after they had gone in that direction for a while they saw smoke. Then Tcîsgoa′n
led, and two others went with him. A child was playing at the time at the side of
the house farthest from that to which he came. He then ran toward him. And he chased
him to the house. Unable to catch him, he chased him into the house. When he took
hold of his mother he took him and his mother both. Those in the house were frightened.
He-who-was-going-to-be-Gia′gudjañ came in after him.
</p>
<p>One person went behind the house. Five persons went out, and he seized one. He was
an old man. And, when he laid hold of the other four, a terrible fellow (a Bellabella)
got hold of him. That (i.e., the Haida) was Gilᴀsta′gu. He let these four go. Then
the Bellabella began to stab him. After he had struck him four times his younger brother
came to him. And he also turned quickly upon him. And another one who came up with
a pistol he slapped on his nose. He knocked him down. Then he (the Haida) shot him.
He shot true, but he did not feel it. He then struck him with his own knife. After
he had done this several times he fell, and he cut off his head. They say that the
trunk afterward got up.
</p>
<p>They then went to look for those who had gone into the woods. They shouted out near
by: “Ho ho ho′ho ho′, I am Łtᴀ′nqawōns.” There they got six persons. They also killed
one.
</p>
<p>When they went away and passed out of the inlet they saw a canoe in the distance.
They then remained behind a point. They talked jealously as to which canoe should
take it. There were four. Three were women. They then began to shoot at them.
</p>
<p>Then they upset it, and Gi′tgoa swam over to one whom they had wounded. The man ran
then into the woods, and they pursued him and struck him in the back of the head with
a stone. And they also broke his legs. They cut off his head. But they took the women.
Making an end of this, they went away. Afterward they went home.
</p>
<p>After they came to Kloo all the chiefs talked over where they would <span class="pageNum" id="pb439">[<a href="#pb439">439</a>]</span>have their fort. They discussed the merits of a certain island. By and by they all
thought Town-fort<a class="noteRef" id="n439.22src" href="#n439.22">22</a> was a good one, because it was within easy reach of Tꜝā′łdī,<a class="noteRef" id="n439.23src" href="#n439.23">23</a> whither they went after salmon.
</p>
<p>The men then went to it. After they had been putting up house frames for a while,
they also brought cedar planks there. Then they put them up. Afterward they also brought
the women there. They worked upon the houses. After they had worked upon them for
a while they were done.
</p>
<p>After they had lived there for a while an old Bellabella man whom they had taken died.
They then dragged his body to a steep place. Just before they threw it over they cut
off the head. Then they threw him down. And his little grandchild almost pushed one
of the Kloo men over. He grasped something at the edge of the cliff.
</p>
<p>After they had lived there for a while they went to Skedans to get a wife for the
chief’s child, and they stayed there all night. On the next day they came away. And,
when they came in sight of the fort, they (the fort people) saw Kūdjū′ł (the woman
they had come for) sitting in the canoe. Their minds feeling good, they sang a paddling
song. When evening came her father-in-law called the people to give them Indian tobacco.
When they had the tobacco in their mouths some said one to another: “To-night we will
fool them.” And they went home.
</p>
<p>After we had lain in bed for a while all at once the fort moved. There was a great
catching up of weapons. Two Kloo people were shouting behind thin rocks which stood
near the fort. They heard at the fort the echo of their voices resounding from the
shore. They said that it was the Bellabella.
</p>
<p>They then tied up the slaves. And an old man living down toward the shore added lies
to it. He said that canoes had come below and gone away from him. By and by a shaman
who was there performed. He had a knife in his hand. They sang a song for him there.
Some spirits straightway went out of him. He said he could not find anything terrible
by striking with his knife.
</p>
<p>A brave chief of the Town-of-Djī′gua people had his house at a distance from them.
They shouted to encourage him as he came from it. They made a sound [like a snare
drum] in front of the houses: “A-a-a-a-a-a wa-a-a-a-a-a.” He came down with a knife
to meet anyone [who might be there]. He passed down the trail that leads from the
upper inlet and came quickly out upon the trail on the side toward the sea.
</p>
<p>At that time some went away from the fort. They carried the news to Skedans. They
came quickly the next day to help them. And they landed there. There they gave them
a great deal to eat.
</p>
<p>When fall came they were at Tꜝā′łdī. In the summer after the following winter a slave
that they had, whom young men used to watch, <span class="pageNum" id="pb440">[<a href="#pb440">440</a>]</span>began to defecate in bed so that they were afraid of him. He did this because he had
planned to get away. By and by he escaped with four women. And they launched canoes
and looked for him. They could not find him anywhere. He went off with a gun, a cartridge
box, and a blanket.
</p>
<p>And some Masset chiefs were also there. They had expected to trade [the runaways]
for some Kloo people that they had taken. Those also went away. They then took two
slaves from Qōgī′s.<a class="noteRef" id="n440.24src" href="#n440.24">24</a> There they also took up weapons against each other.
</p>
<p>Afterward, when the planting was over and the salmon berries were ripe, they started
southward. They again fished for halibut. Not the smallest human being remained behind.
And, after they had gone along for a while, they landed at the place where they were
always accustomed to fish. They fished there. After the fishing had gone on for a
while they stopped and went away. They then landed at a certain long sandy beach.
</p>
<p>And Gîtku′n sent some young men after something that they had forgotten at the place
where they had fished. A part of them also went after salmon berries, and some hunted.
And, while they (the young men) were on the way one discovered mats belonging to the
Bellabella spread out to dry at the foot of the trees standing back of the shore.
And the two who were sent in search reached the place where those were sleeping from
whom they had parted and escaped. They came to know about the enemy.
</p>
<p>He (the head man) went at once toward the place where they had landed. And he discovered
enemies about that place. The Town-of-Djī′gua people immediately went thither in two
big canoes. And Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o followed. And, when those who had gone, came
into the inlet they saw the enemy unobserved by the latter. They then got off their
canoes for them. And before they got opposite some one shot at them. They then began
shooting into them.
</p>
<p>Then they pursued [the Bellabella] who led them along to where there were eight more
canoes in the woods. And the Town-of-Djī′gua people began to watch in front of the
canoes. At evening Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o also came there. After they had been there
for a while, Lda′ogwañ<a class="noteRef" id="n440.25src" href="#n440.25">25</a> called out from among the Bellabella: “Father, are you in one of those canoes? I
am Lda′ogwañ.” Then Waters asked: “Why is there such a crowd of people?” “Some want
peace; part want war.” And he said to his daughter: “People always use feathers in
making peace. They are inviolable.”
</p>
<p>After she had talked [to the Bellabella] they heard the sound of a canoe in the darkness.
Then two persons put feathers on the chiefs. And one of them asked for Gîtku′n, but
they pointed out to him a different one.<a class="noteRef" id="n440.26src" href="#n440.26">26</a> He then put feathers on him first. But afterward he put feathers on the chiefs.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb441">[<a href="#pb441">441</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Lda′ogwañ said: “Do not let Skîtg̣adē′s talk, father. The Bellabella are afraid
only of his voice.” A while after this Skîtg̣adē′s stood up. “Wawayiê′la, Wawayiê′la
are you sure of peace, sure of peace? then let me hear the sound of some peace drum.”
Some one at once beat on the thwart of his canoe. “Alas! that is a poor peace drum.”<a class="noteRef" id="n441.27src" href="#n441.27">27</a>
</p>
<p>After the night had worn on for a while day dawned, and the Bellabella took to their
canoes. After they had begun to launch their canoes and had begun to get into them,
those who had come to fight went away. The Bellabella also went after them. The Bellabella
man who had escaped from Sea-grass town was with them.
</p>
<p>After they had paddled almost past them they shot to one side of the Bellabella. They
again put in their cartridges and again they shot. They then sang a chasing song.
And they left the Bellabella behind.
</p>
<p>Not long before daybreak those who had gone to fight came around the point. They said
they had come near enemies. While they were still telling the news the warriors (that
is, the Bellabella) also came. They gathered at an island that lay seaward from them.
The land is called Stiū′djîn.<a class="noteRef" id="n441.28src" href="#n441.28">28</a>
</p>
<p>At that time Wawayiê′la asked Lda′ogwañ: “Do people always carry out what Gîtku′n
bids?” And she said: “Yes, one of his uncles always speaks good words for him. He
(the uncle) will come.”
</p>
<p>By and by Lā′ma went out with three men. He had a great feather bag that Gîtku′n owned
under his arm. He stood up in front of the place where they were. At that time the
slave who escaped from Kloo had a yellow cedar-bark blanket over his head in the stern
of Wawayiê′la’s canoe. He tried to hide himself. They then left a broad space open
for Lā′ma between the ten canoes which were there, but he went in at another place
between the large canoes. Lā′ma recognized the one who had escaped, jumped toward
him, and seized him by the hair. “Are you Gia′oîstîs?” he said to him. and he pulled
his hair up and down. The Bellabella looked at him.
</p>
<p>By and by he put feathers on them. He put feathers on Wawayiê′la. He also put feathers
on Gūnana′otx̣a. After he had put feathers on all of the chiefs he went in.
</p>
<p>After they had looked on a while two Bellabella came in the canoe. All then went down
to the beach. One Bellabella jumped ashore, but they picked up the other, taking hold
of him by the nose. They made fun of him. But Lā′ma and another remained with the
Bellabella. They took one into Gîtku′n’s house; one they took into the house of Waters.<a class="noteRef" id="n441.29src" href="#n441.29">29</a>
</p>
<p>By and by the Bellabella started toward the place where the camp was. Presently they
came in. Then all were afraid. By and by they got in front of them. After they had
been there a while, Ya′koeʟas <span class="pageNum" id="pb442">[<a href="#pb442">442</a>]</span>went and stood outside. What he said when he talked in the foreign tongue was: “Bellabella;
why, Bellabella, do you let yourselves be killed on my account? Come in nearer.” When
he ceased talking all picked up their anchors and placed themselves farther in.
</p>
<p>After some time had passed, a [secret-society] eagle made a noise behind the town.
Those in the canoes became ashamed.<a class="noteRef" id="n442.30src" href="#n442.30">30</a> After they had held their heads down for a while Gūnana′otx̣a stood up in one canoe.
After he had sung a song by himself they began to sing for him. At that time he jumped
up and down as he danced.
</p>
<p lang="hax" class="small">Wa⁺ u⁺ ho ya ē waho yo ya ha⁺ wa yä yī wa wo häyä′ ī ha wä
<br>Lasaxā′nokwa ʟa sūwa ō hī ōx̣iä wa hā′ ya ē, etc.<a class="noteRef" id="n442.31src" href="#n442.31">31</a>
</p>
<p>At that time they took Ya′koeʟas out. They brought Lda′ogwañ ashore at once. Afterward
all came ashore. Then the women carried their things up. The things (guns) might go
off against each other [therefore the men held themselves ready]. The Bellabella also
held their guns. They took up their things into the houses into which they had invited
them. They carried off their mats into the woods.<a class="noteRef" id="n442.32src" href="#n442.32">32</a>
</p>
<p>The Bellabella were hungry. “Come and eat halibut after having had a long fast.” And
that day they went off. After the others had left the uncle of a child that [the Haida]
had captured gave them a Skidegate man and much property for it. They now became good
friends forever. They ceased to fight with the Bellabella people. And the following
day they returned.
</p>

<p class="first center">[Told by Abraham, of Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o]
</p>
<p>After they had spent some time in preparation they started off—Those-born-at-Skedans,<a class="noteRef" id="n444.1src" href="#n444.1">1</a> the Town-of-Djī′gua people,<a class="noteRef" id="n444.2src" href="#n444.2">2</a> and Those-born-at-Qꜝā′dᴀsg̣o.<a class="noteRef" id="n444.3src" href="#n444.3">3</a> They spent the night on the open sea. When they approached Gîtgia′gᴀs<a class="noteRef" id="n444.4src" href="#n444.4">4</a> day dawned for them. They were in eight canoes.
</p>
<p>Then four went sailing southward of them along in front. And then they passed in at
Gîtgia′gᴀs island, which stretched out before them. After a little while the noise
of guns arose there. Afterward three persons came along in a canoe, the one in the
middle standing up. He was a Kitkatla man, who also called himself an Eagle.<a class="noteRef" id="n444.5src" href="#n444.5">5</a>
</p>
<p>He asked them then: “What war is this? What war is this? I am Lawā′y.” He then invited
us. He invited the chief, Gîtku′n, and all. These people were going to hunt sea otter.
He gave them a great deal of food.<a class="noteRef" id="n444.6src" href="#n444.6">6</a> And they stayed there over night. During the night plenty of salmon<a class="noteRef" id="n444.7src" href="#n444.7">7</a> came in. The next day they went away.
</p>
<p>They kept then out at sea. They landed at Point Qᴀ′lg̣a-i. They now began to keep
the war rules there. The next morning they began to drink sea water.<a class="noteRef" id="n444.8src" href="#n444.8">8</a> They had three shamans. After they had drunk sea water for a while G̣ᴀ′ndox’s-father<a class="noteRef" id="n444.9src" href="#n444.9">9</a> performed. He said then: “War people, which will be good? Here is Town-singers; here
is Days.<span class="corr" id="xd32e30499" title="Not in source">”</span><a class="noteRef" id="n444.10src" href="#n444.10">10</a>
</p>
<p>By and by he told the war people to get their paddles in a hurry. And they got their
paddles. And they carried him away on their paddles from where he sat on the sand.
He then looked at them. After some [other power] had gone out of him Łᴀ′gua<a class="noteRef" id="n444.11src" href="#n444.11">11</a> went in. He told them to put their hands upon his hair. All did so at once. His hair
was long. Very many warriors pulled his hair. When they let go he had few hairs left.
</p>
<p>Afterward another performed. After they had sung for him a while he rolled over and
over in front of the eight fires which stood in a line. When he came to the last one,
he said “wa” in pain, because they were going to leave one dead.
</p>
<p>On the next day they went away. And they stayed at Diâ′g̣ᴀl all night. On the day
after that they reached the mouth of the inlet. They hunted now for a suitable place
to land canoes, because they were cold at night. Then they landed the canoes. At daybreak
they brought up two buckets of sea water, a small bucket and a large bucket. And,
while they drank, Gᴀ′ndox’s-father performed. He <span class="pageNum" id="pb445">[<a href="#pb445">445</a>]</span>again asked the war people: “Which will be good? Here is Town-singers. Here is Days.”
And, without thinking, they chose Days.
</p>
<p>After they had sat there for a while Gᴀ′ndox’s-father said: “To the woods, to the
woods. I feel strange because my eye twitches.” And after they had gone into the woods
a canoe came along. After it, another; after it, another. Lo! seven canoes passed
in front of them. Those were the Gîtî′sda people. They could not do anything. They
were waiting for the day that the shaman had appointed. Although the [Haida] canoes
stuck out [of the woods] they did not see them.
</p>
<p>During a previous war expedition a man whose wife was steering for him passed in front
of the place where they had landed. And the woman came toward them. After she had
come along for a while, picking berries, she discovered the war canoes. She turned
about at once and ran away. Her husband in the canoe held a gun. At that time six
of them chased her. <span class="corr" id="xd32e30519" title="Source: He-who-was-going-to-be Gia′gudjañ">He-who-was-going-to-be-Gia′gudjañ</span> ran in after the woman. By and by he shot [the man]. He floated still upon the water.
They pulled him in. Then, however, they shot into him and killed him.
</p>
<p>On this night they camped at the same place where the person had been shot. When day
broke, a white canoe sail passed up in the middle of the inlet. On that night they
landed farther up. Lda′ogwañ<a class="noteRef" id="n445.12src" href="#n445.12">12</a> acted as pilot. They were near the place to which they were bound.
</p>
<p>They went along that night and stole up on the side opposite the fort of those that
they were going against. And those who went in advance jumped off under a cliff. They
got off where two canoes were anchored. They pulled the canoes off. The fort people
were gathering salal-berries. And they smashed the canoes. On the shore near them
a slight crackling noise was heard.
</p>
<p>Day began to dawn. Then they landed a little way off from this, near the place whither
they were bound. And two were sent to reconnoiter. They came back at once on the run.
They said that there were very many salmon hooks stuck into the ground at the edge
of the water.
</p>
<p>They now got off the canoes. I also got off with them. They crossed a salmon creek
in a crowd. Those who were friends kept together. Two persons acted as leaders. These
gave commands. They told them to sit down. They sat down at once. By and by one of
those who had gone scouting came to them. He searched in his box, and they thought
he was looking for a weapon. Presently a crackling arose in the woods, and they lay
on the ground.
</p>
<p>By and by, when they said “hūk,”<a class="noteRef" id="n445.13src" href="#n445.13">13</a> they ran into the house. I went in with them. Wa wa wa wa, they tried to take each
other for slaves. Presently all got out. They discovered it [their mistake]. They
then went out at once. And Gia′gudjañ’s companions came <span class="pageNum" id="pb446">[<a href="#pb446">446</a>]</span>along at the same time.<a class="noteRef" id="n446.14src" href="#n446.14">14</a> Then [one canoe] had gone after some who went to pick berries, and all went after
it.
</p>
<p>They followed them then for a while. They went to the place where the canoe was to
get the mats that were there. And they jumped off and vied one with another in getting
the mats. A certain one got off last. While they were standing about in the place
where the mats had lain [he saw] a new mat, and he was glad to have discovered it
and went thither. There two women were lying. He then seized them. He raised his voice
and called his name. When they came there and reached the two women they were sound
asleep on the top of the rock where they were sitting.
</p>
<p>When they took them into the canoes one of them talked with Lda′ogwañ.<a class="noteRef" id="n446.15src" href="#n446.15">15</a> She afterward said to the warriors that they might take the fort. “There are no guns
there,” she said. They then placed themselves behind a long, narrow point on the inlet
above the fort. From there they looked at the fort.
</p>
<p>After they had been there some time Skîtg̣adē′s<a class="noteRef" id="n446.16src" href="#n446.16">16</a> stood up and said that he would go there. He summoned the brave men out of all the
canoes to go with him. They went then with him, the brave ones. And they gave out
the following plan: “We are going toward the place where they always steam hemlock
bark.” And they told the rest to follow them.
</p>
<p>Coming along as if they were visitors, they moved their paddles slowly. The people
of the fort gambled in lines without paying any attention to them. When they came
near land the remainder also came on. But they still did not concern themselves about
them.
</p>
<p>When they got near those who were in advance discharged their guns. And the remainder
also landed there. Hu hu hu hu, they shot into them. Some had fled from the fort.
They all landed in fright on the shore opposite the back of the fort.
</p>
<p>A man of the Gîtî′sda people then did the fighting. He ran about on the top of the
fort. Presently he shot a Kloo man dead. And, as he ran about on the tops of the houses,
they shot him, so that he fell down between them. Two boys were with him. They went
back a short distance from the fort and began to shoot down upon them (the Haida)
from above.
</p>
<p>Now they (the Kloo people) fled. Seven canoes went out to sea at once. We placed ourselves
in hiding close by. By and by some one shouted from out at sea: “They are running
down to the fort.” These were three Kloo men who had hidden themselves there. At that
time they enslaved two children.
</p>
<p>We went thither. Those that were out at sea also came in. They started at once to
seize the fort. Hu hu hu hu hu, they went into the houses in a crowd. At that time
I went for tobacco only. They <span class="pageNum" id="pb447">[<a href="#pb447">447</a>]</span>enslaved all who were sitting in the houses. They took all sorts of things.
</p>
<p>Presently some one shouted: “Î′ldjiwas’s father<a class="noteRef" id="n447.17src" href="#n447.17">17</a> fell.” They immediately went to the canoes. When I passed between the houses I came
upon a dead body lying there. And one who came after me cut off the head. I then moved
down the face of a steep place toward the sea in a sitting posture. A part of the
people were off on the water in their canoes. I was glad when I got into [a canoe].<a class="noteRef" id="n447.18src" href="#n447.18">18</a>
</p>
<p>Gia′gudjañ captured a box. After he brought it out and while he was sitting near it
he was shot. He was wounded. They got him in. Half of them they could not get away
from the fort. By and by three stood in Reef-canoe.<a class="noteRef" id="n447.19src" href="#n447.19">19</a> One began to load their guns. Presently they started toward it. Sky<a class="noteRef" id="n447.20src" href="#n447.20">20</a> steered for them. As they went [toward the fort] he shot toward the place from which
they had been firing.
</p>
<p>By and by they reached the fort. After they had gone up into it they started back.
At once they shot at them from the place out of which they had shot before. After
a while they got out safely. When they got away the [Gîtî′sda] people came out to
the fort. They (the Haida) took away a small part of the property. The body of the
Kloo man was left there.
</p>
<p>Now they started away. The two canoes of Gîtku′n<a class="noteRef" id="n447.21src" href="#n447.21">21</a> and his sons went empty. The other people sang songs of victory. Then a mat sail
came along toward them. And one was in the canoe. Gîtku′n enslaved him.
</p>
<p>This person said that some people lived farther down on the inlet. He (Gîtku′n) could
not persuade them to go after them.
</p>
<p>They got ashore then and sent tobacco to the Kloo man through the fire.<a class="noteRef" id="n447.22src" href="#n447.22">22</a> At that time Gîtku′n said to the Sqoā′ładas<a class="noteRef" id="n447.23src" href="#n447.23">23</a> man who had the severed head: “Say, brother-in-law,<a class="noteRef" id="n447.24src" href="#n447.24">24</a> let me have his head instead of you.” He threw it over to him at once. This is how
the saying “Somebody’s head cut off”<a class="noteRef" id="n447.25src" href="#n447.25">25</a> started.
</p>
<p>When they afterward came out into open water they came out directly opposite a big
canoe that was going along the open coast. They then pursued it, and it distanced
the Kloo people. Afterward they came to Kloo.
</p>
<p class="small">The Gîtî′sda, or Kittizoo, constituted the southernmost division of the Tsimshian,
being situated on Seaforth channel, an extension of Milbank sound. Unlike most war
stories, this does not begin by describing some previous injury inflicted by the people
attacked. The breakdown of old customs was evidently beginning at this time, and it
is said that no expeditions of importance have occurred since this one. As is seen,
my informant accompanied the expedition.

<h3 class="main">Encoding</h3>
<p>The Haida language in this work is written with a number of additional symbols (see
the <a href="#intro.alphabet">Introduction</a>), some of which are common punctuation marks. To disambiguate those marks and make
processing easier, those marks have been replaced with more specialized Unicode characters
that look similar. Their use also make the text slightly more readable.

</p>
<p>A number of additional characters and combinations appear that are not explained in
the Introduction. These have been left unchanged.
</p>
<p>Since the titles of stories are set in small-caps, it is not possible to distinguish
small-caps styled <span class="sc">a</span> from the special letter ᴀ. When unsure, they have been encoded as a, but where possible,
the special letter ᴀ has been restored in such cases. The upper-case of ʟ is not defined
in Unicode (and would be hard to distinguish from a regular upper-case L). However,
cases of Ḷ are always the uppercase variant of ʟ̣.
</p>
<p>Hyphenated Haida words have been restored, using a soft-hyphen character, except when
the unhyphenated word is present in the text, in which case the hyphen is removed
or retained as the case may be.
</p>
<p>Repeated words and phrases in songs were indicated with |:&nbsp;…&nbsp;:|, these have been replaced
with the Unicode musical repeat signs 𝄆&nbsp;…&nbsp;𝄇.
</p>
<p>All end-notes have been moved in-line in the TEI file, and will appear as end-notes
again in the finale generated HTML versions. Some notes have been renumbered as a
result.
</p>
<p>This book contains three main parts, in the first part, the English translation and
intralinear text were placed underneath each other on the same page, in the second
part, the translation and original text were placed on facing pages, with the English
left and Haida right, and finally, in the third part, we only have English translations.
In unpaged media, this cannot be reproduced, so here I have placed the intralinear
text after the English in the first part and placed the English and Haide side-by-side
in the second part.
